        "description_narrative":["Within the proposed project Schiphorst Holding and Gardi Tours will establish a private training institute in hotel and tourism management. The Institute will offer a one year college programme for students and contracted training for shorter periods for employees in the hotel and tourism industry. The Institute will consist of classroom training facilities, as well as on-the-job training facilities in the form of limited hotel rooms, a restaurant and hotel reception and shop. Next to the Institute a dormitory will be constructed for on-campus students from outside Ulaanbaatar.The training programme will be developed, implemented and monitored by INHolland University of Applied Sciences, Department of Tourism and Recreation management, and the Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST), Department of Tourism management and Regional studies. INHolland and MUST will train the Mongolian teachers who will teach students and hotel/tourism personnel at the Institute.The rationale for the proposed project is the rapid growth of the tourism industry in Mongolia combined with the current lack of adequately trained Mongolian hotel and tourism management personnel. At the Institute Mongolian students and hotel/tourism personnel will acquire the necessary professional skills in order to acquire management positions in one of the existing or new (international) hotels and tourism enterprises in Mongolia. The majority of management jobs are currently occupied by foreign personnel due to the lack of qualified Mongolians. Through the 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management, this project will improve the employment opportunities and income conditions for Mongolian students and people working in the hotel and tourism industry and provide a stimulus for the further development of the industry in Mongolia.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The project is supported by the Mongolian Ministries of Education and Tourism. The Institute and the educational programme will be certified by the Ministry of Education.Impact•\tEmployment and working conditionsThe Institute will employ 8 full-time Mongolian mentor and assistant teachers, 4 part-time Mongolian/foreign visiting lecturers and 8 Mongolian / foreign staff members. Besides 3 Mongolian guards, all are medium-/high-level employees. In the second year after the project's completion the Institute will employ 14 full-time Mongolian teachers, 7 part-time Mongolian/foreign visiting lecturers and 11 Mongolian/foreign staff members, of which 3 guards. Wages are on average 20% higher than the regular wages for similar jobs in Mongolia. This is related to the higher workload of mentor and assistant teachers compared to regular schools and universities. All teachers will be given board and lodging in the city or at the campus and a contribution in their pension and medical insurance plan.•\tInnovation / Transfer of knowledgeThe envisioned concept of vocational training in a realistic hotel/restaurant setting, similar to the European \"hotel schools\", is completely new in Mongolia. The transfer of knowledge will focus on understanding western expectations of the touristic product. This aspect is new to Mongolian teachers in the field of hotel/tourism management. After being trained by staff from INHolland and MUST, they will in turn transfer this knowledge to Mongolian students and hotel / tourism personnel. The knowledge transfer will lead to an 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management in Mongolia.•\tChain effectsThrough the 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management, the project will improve the employment opportunities for Mongolian students and people working in the hotel and tourism industry. The availability of qualified local hotel/tourism personnel will in turn stimulate further development of the tourism industry in Mongolia.It is expected that other public and private universities in Mongolia will copy the vocational training methods. In fact, the Mongolian Ministry of Education has already adopted a policy of stimulating vocational training centres.•\tEnvironmentThe construction of the Institute will pose no environmental threat since there is no special flora or fauna at the site in Ulaanbaatar. The Institute will pay special attention to responsible management regarding the environment. Hotel/tourism managers who are trained at the Institute will influence the decision making process regarding environmental aspects in their own companies.•\tPosition of womenWithin the workforce of teachers and staff, special attention will be paid with respect to hiring female employees. They will have equal salary and rights for similar positions as male employees.",

        "description_narrative":["Within the proposed project Schiphorst Holding and Gardi Tours will establish a private training institute in hotel and tourism management. The Institute will offer a one year college programme for students and contracted training for shorter periods for employees in the hotel and tourism industry. The Institute will consist of classroom training facilities, as well as on-the-job training facilities in the form of limited hotel rooms, a restaurant and hotel reception and shop. Next to the Institute a dormitory will be constructed for on-campus students from outside Ulaanbaatar.The training programme will be developed, implemented and monitored by INHolland University of Applied Sciences, Department of Tourism and Recreation management, and the Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST), Department of Tourism management and Regional studies. INHolland and MUST will train the Mongolian teachers who will teach students and hotel/tourism personnel at the Institute.The rationale for the proposed project is the rapid growth of the tourism industry in Mongolia combined with the current lack of adequately trained Mongolian hotel and tourism management personnel. At the Institute Mongolian students and hotel/tourism personnel will acquire the necessary professional skills in order to acquire management positions in one of the existing or new (international) hotels and tourism enterprises in Mongolia. The majority of management jobs are currently occupied by foreign personnel due to the lack of qualified Mongolians. Through the 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management, this project will improve the employment opportunities and income conditions for Mongolian students and people working in the hotel and tourism industry and provide a stimulus for the further development of the industry in Mongolia.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The project is supported by the Mongolian Ministries of Education and Tourism. The Institute and the educational programme will be certified by the Ministry of Education.Impact•\tEmployment and working conditionsThe Institute will employ 8 full-time Mongolian mentor and assistant teachers, 4 part-time Mongolian/foreign visiting lecturers and 8 Mongolian / foreign staff members. Besides 3 Mongolian guards, all are medium-/high-level employees. In the second year after the project's completion the Institute will employ 14 full-time Mongolian teachers, 7 part-time Mongolian/foreign visiting lecturers and 11 Mongolian/foreign staff members, of which 3 guards. Wages are on average 20% higher than the regular wages for similar jobs in Mongolia. This is related to the higher workload of mentor and assistant teachers compared to regular schools and universities. All teachers will be given board and lodging in the city or at the campus and a contribution in their pension and medical insurance plan.•\tInnovation / Transfer of knowledgeThe envisioned concept of vocational training in a realistic hotel/restaurant setting, similar to the European \"hotel schools\", is completely new in Mongolia. The transfer of knowledge will focus on understanding western expectations of the touristic product. This aspect is new to Mongolian teachers in the field of hotel/tourism management. After being trained by staff from INHolland and MUST, they will in turn transfer this knowledge to Mongolian students and hotel / tourism personnel. The knowledge transfer will lead to an 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management in Mongolia.•\tChain effectsThrough the 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management, the project will improve the employment opportunities for Mongolian students and people working in the hotel and tourism industry. The availability of qualified local hotel/tourism personnel will in turn stimulate further development of the tourism industry in Mongolia.It is expected that other public and private universities in Mongolia will copy the vocational training methods. In fact, the Mongolian Ministry of Education has already adopted a policy of stimulating vocational training centres.•\tEnvironmentThe construction of the Institute will pose no environmental threat since there is no special flora or fauna at the site in Ulaanbaatar. The Institute will pay special attention to responsible management regarding the environment. Hotel/tourism managers who are trained at the Institute will influence the decision making process regarding environmental aspects in their own companies.•\tPosition of womenWithin the workforce of teachers and staff, special attention will be paid with respect to hiring female employees. They will have equal salary and rights for similar positions as male employees.",

        "description_narrative":["Within the proposed project Schiphorst Holding and Gardi Tours will establish a private training institute in hotel and tourism management. The Institute will offer a one year college programme for students and contracted training for shorter periods for employees in the hotel and tourism industry. The Institute will consist of classroom training facilities, as well as on-the-job training facilities in the form of limited hotel rooms, a restaurant and hotel reception and shop. Next to the Institute a dormitory will be constructed for on-campus students from outside Ulaanbaatar.The training programme will be developed, implemented and monitored by INHolland University of Applied Sciences, Department of Tourism and Recreation management, and the Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST), Department of Tourism management and Regional studies. INHolland and MUST will train the Mongolian teachers who will teach students and hotel/tourism personnel at the Institute.The rationale for the proposed project is the rapid growth of the tourism industry in Mongolia combined with the current lack of adequately trained Mongolian hotel and tourism management personnel. At the Institute Mongolian students and hotel/tourism personnel will acquire the necessary professional skills in order to acquire management positions in one of the existing or new (international) hotels and tourism enterprises in Mongolia. The majority of management jobs are currently occupied by foreign personnel due to the lack of qualified Mongolians. Through the 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management, this project will improve the employment opportunities and income conditions for Mongolian students and people working in the hotel and tourism industry and provide a stimulus for the further development of the industry in Mongolia.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The project is supported by the Mongolian Ministries of Education and Tourism. The Institute and the educational programme will be certified by the Ministry of Education.Impact•\tEmployment and working conditionsThe Institute will employ 8 full-time Mongolian mentor and assistant teachers, 4 part-time Mongolian/foreign visiting lecturers and 8 Mongolian / foreign staff members. Besides 3 Mongolian guards, all are medium-/high-level employees. In the second year after the project's completion the Institute will employ 14 full-time Mongolian teachers, 7 part-time Mongolian/foreign visiting lecturers and 11 Mongolian/foreign staff members, of which 3 guards. Wages are on average 20% higher than the regular wages for similar jobs in Mongolia. This is related to the higher workload of mentor and assistant teachers compared to regular schools and universities. All teachers will be given board and lodging in the city or at the campus and a contribution in their pension and medical insurance plan.•\tInnovation / Transfer of knowledgeThe envisioned concept of vocational training in a realistic hotel/restaurant setting, similar to the European \"hotel schools\", is completely new in Mongolia. The transfer of knowledge will focus on understanding western expectations of the touristic product. This aspect is new to Mongolian teachers in the field of hotel/tourism management. After being trained by staff from INHolland and MUST, they will in turn transfer this knowledge to Mongolian students and hotel / tourism personnel. The knowledge transfer will lead to an 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management in Mongolia.•\tChain effectsThrough the 'upgrading' of professional skills in hotel and tourism management, the project will improve the employment opportunities for Mongolian students and people working in the hotel and tourism industry. The availability of qualified local hotel/tourism personnel will in turn stimulate further development of the tourism industry in Mongolia.It is expected that other public and private universities in Mongolia will copy the vocational training methods. In fact, the Mongolian Ministry of Education has already adopted a policy of stimulating vocational training centres.•\tEnvironmentThe construction of the Institute will pose no environmental threat since there is no special flora or fauna at the site in Ulaanbaatar. The Institute will pay special attention to responsible management regarding the environment. Hotel/tourism managers who are trained at the Institute will influence the decision making process regarding environmental aspects in their own companies.•\tPosition of womenWithin the workforce of teachers and staff, special attention will be paid with respect to hiring female employees. They will have equal salary and rights for similar positions as male employees.",

Specifically, the project will work on various aspects of the creation of an ‘enabling environment’ for humanitarian assistance, namely: administrative, legal, political and security-related concerns, but also gaps in coordination and support to frontline engagement with authorities.\r\n\r\nAs a network and membership body of over 379 NGOs (263 NNGOs and 116 INGOs), the South Sudan NGO Forum provides a unique platform to promote safe and secure access providing capacity building for NGOs through providing humanitarian training sharing best practices in humanitarian delivery and information exchanges forging collaborations between the INGOs and national NGOs coordinating the collective voices of the NGOs for common positions ensuring accountability to effected populations the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and joint engagement for enabling environment for INGOs and NNGOs operating in South Sudan. The members of NGO Forum are present in all counties of South Sudan and deliver services across all sectors.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow the NGO Forum to continue to effectively support the NGO community in South Sudan by facilitating the protection of humanitarian space and respect for aid workers for improved delivery of humanitarian assistance to save and improved lives. The NGO Forum will strengthen and enhance coordination on issues of security, bureaucratic and access impediments and facilitate joint engagement with authorities, both national and local levels in tackling impediments that interfere with the effective delivery of services to the populations in need. The project will also focus on identifying and supporting referral pathways for the reporting of cases of sexual exploitation and abuse, and increasing the understanding across the sector of how to prevent or respond to cases.\r\n\r\nThe project will also support the review of the NGO Act 2016 to ensure humanitarian space and NGO space are protected for continued delivery of assistance to populations I need. In a similar vein the project will further support the development of information systems for NGO staffing with the national Ministry of Labour to help protect NGOs national staff whose positions are regularly politicized at field levels. This will provide national level assurance and protection of legally recruited NGO national staff.  \r\n\r\nThe NGO Forum has a 3-person security team at the national-level. To enhance the effectiveness of this team, in the interests of members, this project will help to project safety and security support and best practices to the states by providing safety, security and PSEA focal points who are focused on ensuring members are safe, able to operate effectively and within the guidelines of best practice, such as on PSEA.\r\nThe project will build on the improved relations with national level government authorities to improve relations with local authorities to reduce bureaucratic impediments and to improve acknowledgement of NGOs’ humanitarian identity and adherence to humanitarian principles and contribute to safe operating environments and allow access to populations in need of assistance. The project will facilitate workshops at national level with state agencies such as the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) to identify key issues affecting humanitarian agency operations. The state level workshops will be held with local authorities to discuss these issues affecting humanitarian programmes and solutions and action plans will be identified. COVID-19 awareness outreach information dissemination will be part and parcel of every engagements under project."],

During the same period NGO Forum's online web resources recorded a total of 6,8 million unique page views serving over 117,000 users, ranking the website among the most visited sites in South Sudan. Safety, Security and Crisis Management: From September 2019 to February 2020, the NGO Forum Security Team coordinated the relocation of 198 NGO workers through the Saving Lives Together (SLT) framework with the support of UNHAS,WFP, UNDSS and OCHA. Under SLT there were 392 information exchanges and meetings held between NGO Forum and UNDSS/UNMISS. The Security Team also provided security incident datatsets and area profiles on request. Advocacy, Policy and External Engagement: NGO Forum has broadened its relationships and engagement with ministries and authorities of all parties to the conflict, in order to support Forum members to access beneficiaries without hindrance, or resolve impediments when they arise (for example relating to tax issues). This has reduced costs to NGOs and the wider humanitarian community in operations, financial, human resource and time terms and has helped bring about increased clarity and understanding in the operating environment.  NGO's Networking and Capacity Development: From September 2019 to February 2020,  NGO Forum through its Focal Point member CIPAD provided gender mainstreaming, Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and trauma healing strategies training to 60 NGOs in Juba. Through this initiative the NGO Forum also developed a model PSEA policy and code of conduct that the NGO Forum has asked national NGOs to adopt and adapt for use and opeartionalise."],

The NGO Forum is a member-based platform with more than 300 international and national NGO members in South Sudan. The NGO Forum's goal is to contribute to a more efficient and coordinated humanitarian and long-term development support in South Sudan. To achieve this, the NGO Forum Secretariat supoprts coordination, communication, advocacy, capacity development and security cooperation among the large number of NGOs delivering services and contributing to peace building and development in the country. Sida's assessment is that NGO Forum's activities, designed by the members during many years of cooperation, are relevant, effective and meet the needs of a changing and extremely challenging context. It is also Sida's assessment that the NGO Forum Secretariat has adequate capacity to carry out its activities and that the Concern Worldwide (as a host organisation/fund administrator of the secretariat) is a reliable partner.",

NGO Forums mål är att bidra till ett mer effektivt och samordnat humanitärt och långsiktigt utvecklingsstöd i Sydsudan. För att uppnå detta stödjer NGO Forums sekretariat samordning, kommunikation, påverksansarbete, kapacitetsutveckling, samt säkerhetssamarbete bland det stora antal NGO:er som levererar service och bidrar till fredsbyggande och utveckling i landet. Det är Sidas bedömning att NGO Forums verksamhet, som utformats av medlemmarna under många års samarbete, är relevant, effektiv och motsvarar behoven i en föränderlig och synnerligen utmanande kontext. Det är även Sidas bedömning att NGO Forums sekretariat har erfoderlig kapacitet att fortsätta genomföra dess aktiviteter. samt att Concern Worldwide (som värdorganisation/fondadministratör för sekreteriatet) utgör en tillförlitlig samarbetspartner.",

The NGO Forum will strengthen and enhance coordination on issues of security, bureaucratic and access impediments and facilitate joint engagement with authorities, both national and local levels in tackling impediments that interfere with the effective delivery of services to the populations in need. The project will build on the improved relations with national level government authorities to improve relations with local authorities to reduce bureaucratic impediments and to improve acknowledgement of NGOs’ humanitarian identify and adherence to humanitarian principles and contribute to safe operating environments and allow access to populations in need of assistance. The project will facilitate workshops at national level with state agencies such as the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) to identify key issues affecting humanitarian agency operations. The state level workshops will be held with local authorities to discuss these issues affecting humanitarian programmes and solutions and action plans will be identified."],

        "description_narrative":["The Bureaucratic Liaison Unit (BLU) project aims to lead the work of the NGO forum on issues related to government legislation and regulations affecting work of NGOs in Iraq, such that NGOs are more effectively able to deliver humanitarian, post-emergency and early recovery programming for millions of Iraqis in need.  \r\nMost importantly, the BLU will act as an information resource for NGOs regarding the relevant and updated procedures, contacts and best practice for NGOs for: registration, visas, taxes, importation, reporting and other administrative services and requirements with the authorities in central and northern Iraq. To do so, the BLU will provide relevant legal and regulatory information in English and Arabic, as well as templates, contact lists and associated costs for service providers and procedures. With support from NCCI’s Information Management Unit, the BLU will develop guidance material to support NGO relationships with primary government counterparts as identified and directed by the NCCI Executive Board and Executive Director. The BLU will serve as a guide to NGOs regarding the official and unofficial best practices regarding the bureaucracy in Iraq and provide bilateral and coordinated responses to enquiries.\r\nThe BLU will develop and maintain productive relationships with relevant actors, including the local authorities, United Nations and diplomatic community. In particular, local and high level liaison with national and regional authorities will enable timely information gathering and analysis of opportunities for advocacy. The BLU will facilitate strategic engagement and timely information sharing between the NGO forum with Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator and UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), contributing to an effective partnership in support of NGOs operating in Iraq.\r\nThe BLU will track the trends and impact of bureaucratic impediments on NGO operations, through regular surveys or other appropriate means, in order to enable timely and targeted advocacy with authorities and influencers.\r\nThe BLU will ensure strong linkages within the forum groups to enable strategic engagement and advocacy by the Executive Board, Executive Director, Advocacy Coordinator and HR/Admin Working Group. Provision of regular information to the designated leads for inclusion in relevant working groups, external meetings and advocacy engagement of the NGO Steering Committee will allow NCCI’s capacity to deliver the required support.\r\nWith a mandate for service provision, the Bureaucratic Liaison Unit will:\r\n\tMaintain an accessible repository of laws, regulations, circulars and other government instructions that are relevant to the work of NGOs in Iraq\r\n\tBe familiar with the content of laws, regulations, circulars and other government instructions that are relevant to the work of NGOs in Iraq, in order to advise NGOs of the existence of relevant clauses. (However, interpretation and application of such clauses is left to the responsibility of individual NGOs and their legal advisers).\r\n\tCollect, analyze and disseminate information on trends and impact of regulations and procedures on NGO operations, including through position papers and information management products.\r\n\tEnable timely and effective advocacy by NCCI groups and members, such that the regulatory environment facilitates NGOs to deliver assistance at scale and according to vulnerability.\r\n\tContribute to NGO engagement with the government and other key stakeholders regarding the development of laws and regulations that affect the work of NGOs in Iraq (through, for example, tracking how issues are affecting NGOs, developing appropriate briefing papers, and attending relevant meetings).\r\n\tAs directed by the Executive Director and the Executive Board, map, develop and maintain contacts with key government staff/advisors involved in regulatory issues affecting NGOs, in order to keep updated on regulations and"],

        "description_narrative":["Uganda National NGO Forum was launched in 1997 following two years of concerted work to develop the operational structure, a Constitution and membership recruitment program. Many NGOs had realised the need to engage Government and the donor community on policy issues and poverty concerns. Also, Government found it increasingly important to involve Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the design and implementation of policies and programmes.\rThe idea to form UNNGOF was to establish an organization that would wholly represent CSOs while bringing together National NGOs, International NGOs, CBOs, Voluntary Development Organizations (VDOs), and Farmers# Groups, Cooperative Associations and other Citizens# Organizations and interest groups from all thematic areas.\rThe first General Assembly of UNNGOF was held in January of 1997 after nationwide sensitization and mass mobilization. About 1,000 NGO representatives participated and it was agreed that the Forum would create a comprehensive membership base that would meet periodically to choose and renew leadership and other governance organs in a democratic manner. Since then, UNNGOF has never wavered in providing a platform and leadership for CSOs on behalf of the poor and through time, created a neutral ground for all NGOs to constructively interact.\rBy 2001, UNNGOF had established policies and procedures for accountability, established formal registration for members, operationaliseda code of conduct, amended the Constitution by re-mobilizing members, developed a three year rights-based Strategic Plan, and set up district forums for support at district level and to the Secretariat.\rCurrently, UNNGOF brings together 630 member organizations across the country. As a platform organization, UNNGOF has over the last 20 years UNNGOF has built capacity to convene diverse organizations to work on various collective initiatives. Further, it has also established itself as a credible partner with various government agencies where it plays a representational role forcivil society. Gender integration is an issue that we take seriously and forall our program activities we ensure that women and men are well represented.\r2. ACHIEVEMENTS\rWhat have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?\rCoordinating Civil Society Policy Advocacy\rOver the last three years, there was increased participation of civil society in policy formulation. The first ever monitoring survey of the Vision 2040 was launched in 2014 and reached over 1000 households through the national survey in all districts of Uganda. UNNGOF coordinated Civil society input in the development of the second National Development Plan and over 10 issues papers were shared with the government. UNNGOF worked closely with civil society in the post 2015 agenda that led to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals. This process reached over 4000 citizens across Uganda and civil society voice was present in the global collective messaging on the post 2015 agenda in New York as well as civil society work nationally. This work has anchored UNNGOF in the policy arena inUganda. This is evident from UNNGOF#s representational role on major policy committees in the Office of the Prime Minister, National Planning Authority and Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social development.\rSupporting the work of Sub-National Civil Society\rUNNGOFhas offered leadership to civil Society at the sub-national level through the collective organizing around civil society issues of a cross cutting nature. We have been instrumental in bringing together civil society under campaigns like Black Mondayand the development of the National Development Plan as well as linking civil society to national policy agenda. The sub-national level today boasts of several organisations that are seen as strong Civil society leaders in their regions with most of themlinked to the investmentand partnership that UNNGOF has developed through the support to Advocacy Networks infrastructure as well as the work we have continued to spearhead under the Citizen Manifesto.\r\rCivic engagement on Civic Space\rUNNGOF has been aproactive convener and interlocutorin many processes hat bring together Civil Society and decision makers at various levels. At the local level , the citizen manifesto has provided such a space for citizen-leader interactions. At the national level we have been instrumental in convening meetings between the Minster of Internal affairs and civil society leaders on several topical issues. These processes have created avenues forbuilding confidence among civil society and government and political leaders onmatters of mutual interest.\r\r3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE\rMission: What is the current purpose of the organisation?\r\rTo provide a sharing and reflection platform for Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) to influence governance and development processes in Uganda and enhance their operating environment.\rInstitutional objectives: What are the principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?\ra) A strong and well coordinated civil society sector with information and capacity to effectively engage in and contribute to development processes.\rb) Citizens with a greater awareness of their own situation, mobilised, informed and actively participating in policy, governance and development processes.\rc) Civic space and CSO operating environment influenced positively at the local and global level and influencing citizen engagement in governance processes.\rd) Citizen responsive government policy and practice alternatives generated through evidence building and advocacy at all levels.\re) A dynamic UNNGOF identity and presence built in Uganda and across East Africa and globally through our results, learning and communication as well imaginative knowledge brokering.\rf) Cost-efficient support to the secretariat that fosters an institutional culture of optimal re-source use that better enables UNNGOF to accomplish its objectives.\r\rField(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actors that benefit from the work?\rUNNGOF is a national platform and its work is anchored on two broad intervention areas of civil society strengthening and Influencing Development Policy and Practice. We therefore undertake activities in three complementary program components. Thesecomponents are supported by two functions which include; a) Results, learning and Communication and b) Corporate Services\rPolicy Advocacy and State Engagement Under this programme component, we focus on effectively coordinating NGOs engagement on multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral policy processes-NDPs, National Level Budget Analysis, Aid and Development Effectiveness, 2030 Agenda and EAC among others.\rCivic Space and governance monitoring. This component area we seek to influence internal and external operating environment issues of CSOs and ensure a positive environment for NGO operations and citizen engagement in governance processes. The focus is on coordination of NGO legislation efforts; promoting enabling environment and monitoring governanceprocesses through initiative like the Citizen Manifesto-\rCivil Society Strengthening Under this intervention area, UNNGOF will continue to provide capacity development initiatives in several ways. These will include; work related to strengthening BoardsofDirectors of CSOs organizations, work with Women Leaders in civil society as well as general capacity development work for organizations.  Evaluation results of the last strategic plan indicate that there is a need for more innovation in the area ofcapacity development so that it creates more impact and is more relevant to our members and constituencies.  We shall, therefore, seek to develop initiatives with universities and otherinstitutions of higher learning.\rWhile UNNGOF is a national platform, italso hosts the Support Program for Advocacy Networks that brings together 35 District Networks with a combined reach to 3000 civil society organizations across the country.  The infrastructure described above gives us the leverage to be able to reach millions and work with a diversity of organizations including those in underserved areas.\r\r4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING\rAnalyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? In this context, what is unique about the position of theorganisation?\rUNNGOF operates in an environment where citizens are debased as these focus on individual politicians rather than public service delivery institutions. This focuson individuals rather than institutions fuels both political patronage and elite patronage which affects quality service delivery and government accountability.\rFor civil society, these challenges constrain civil space and citizen participationin state politics and lead to the emergence of a #debased citizenry#. The effect of this individual merit hangover on Uganda#s citizen-state relationship is therefore a context that limits citizen engagement, participation and even appreciation of political diversity.\rUNNGOF has a number of partners and collaborators and these include; District Networks - collaborate in the area of programming and expanding our work to reach millions of citizens; National Networks and NGOs - collective advocacy on issues of national interest - like the National Budget, the NGO Law, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Vision 2040; Media-toamplify our voice and disseminate our issues to all partners in government and outside government; Citizen groups: Get feedbackon issues that affect their livelihood to be relayed to policy makers and implementers and Government which is a key advocacy target forour work on influencing development policies and practice.\rUNNGOF#s niche is its character. UNNGOF is a platform anda leaderin collective advocacy initiatives.  While many organizations can do policy advocacy, it takes organizations with the capacity to convene other organizations to have an impact on government policies that are nation-wide.  As a platform organization we aretherefore the #go-to# organization for Government institutions, civil society organizations, donors and citizens group that would like to generate collective positions, engage in coordinated collective advocacy and for reaching millions of citizens.  Italso plays a representational role for civil society in a number of state institutions such as   the National Planning Authority, Office of the Prime Minister implementation committees, the Accountability Sector Working Group and the  Ministry of Gender,Labourand Social Development."],

          "UGANDA NATIONAL NGO FORUM NGO FORUM",
          "Uganda National NGO Forum was launched in 1997 following two years of concerted work to develop the operational structure, a Constitution and membership recruitment program. Many NGOs had realised the need to engage Government and the donor community on policy issues and poverty concerns. Also, Government found it increasingly important to involve Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the design and implementation of policies and programmes.\rThe idea to form UNNGOF was to establish an organization that would wholly represent CSOs while bringing together National NGOs, International NGOs, CBOs, Voluntary Development Organizations (VDOs), and Farmers# Groups, Cooperative Associations and other Citizens# Organizations and interest groups from all thematic areas.\rThe first General Assembly of UNNGOF was held in January of 1997 after nationwide sensitization and mass mobilization. About 1,000 NGO representatives participated and it was agreed that the Forum would create a comprehensive membership base that would meet periodically to choose and renew leadership and other governance organs in a democratic manner. Since then, UNNGOF has never wavered in providing a platform and leadership for CSOs on behalf of the poor and through time, created a neutral ground for all NGOs to constructively interact.\rBy 2001, UNNGOF had established policies and procedures for accountability, established formal registration for members, operationaliseda code of conduct, amended the Constitution by re-mobilizing members, developed a three year rights-based Strategic Plan, and set up district forums for support at district level and to the Secretariat.\rCurrently, UNNGOF brings together 630 member organizations across the country. As a platform organization, UNNGOF has over the last 20 years UNNGOF has built capacity to convene diverse organizations to work on various collective initiatives. Further, it has also established itself as a credible partner with various government agencies where it plays a representational role forcivil society. Gender integration is an issue that we take seriously and forall our program activities we ensure that women and men are well represented.\r2. ACHIEVEMENTS\rWhat have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?\rCoordinating Civil Society Policy Advocacy\rOver the last three years, there was increased participation of civil society in policy formulation. The first ever monitoring survey of the Vision 2040 was launched in 2014 and reached over 1000 households through the national survey in all districts of Uganda. UNNGOF coordinated Civil society input in the development of the second National Development Plan and over 10 issues papers were shared with the government. UNNGOF worked closely with civil society in the post 2015 agenda that led to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals. This process reached over 4000 citizens across Uganda and civil society voice was present in the global collective messaging on the post 2015 agenda in New York as well as civil society work nationally. This work has anchored UNNGOF in the policy arena inUganda. This is evident from UNNGOF#s representational role on major policy committees in the Office of the Prime Minister, National Planning Authority and Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social development.\rSupporting the work of Sub-National Civil Society\rUNNGOFhas offered leadership to civil Society at the sub-national level through the collective organizing around civil society issues of a cross cutting nature. We have been instrumental in bringing together civil society under campaigns like Black Mondayand the development of the National Development Plan as well as linking civil society to national policy agenda. The sub-national level today boasts of several organisations that are seen as strong Civil society leaders in their regions with most of themlinked to the investmentand partnership that UNNGOF has developed through the support to Advocacy Networks infrastructure as well as the work we have continued to spearhead under the Citizen Manifesto.\rCivic engagement on Civic Space\rUNNGOF has been aproactive convener and interlocutor in many processes hat bring together Civil Society and decision makers at various levels. At the local level , the citizen manifestohas provided such a space for citizen-leader interactions. At the national level we have been instrumental in convening meetings between the Minster of Internal affairs and civil society leaders on several topical issues. These processes have created avenues for building confidence among civil society and government and political leaders on matters of mutual interest.\r\r3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE\rMission: What is the current purpose of the organisation?\r\rTo provide a sharing and reflection platform for Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) to influence governance and development processes in Uganda and enhance their operating environment.\rInstitutional objectives: What are the principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?\ra) A strong and well coordinated civil society sector with information and capacity to effectively engage in and contribute to development processes.\rb) Citizens with a greater awareness of their own situation, mobilised, informed and actively participating in policy, governance and development processes.\rc) Civic space and CSO operating environment influenced positively at the local and global level and influencing citizen engagement in governance processes.\rd) Citizen responsive government policy and practice alternatives generated through evidence building and advocacy at all levels.\re) A dynamic UNNGOF identity and presence built in Uganda and across East Africa and globally through our results, learning and communication as well imaginative knowledge brokering.\rf) Cost-efficient support to the secretariat that fosters an institutional culture of optimal re-source use that better enables UNNGOF to accomplish its objectives.\r\rField(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actors that benefit from the work?\rUNNGOF is a national platform and its work is anchored on two broad intervention areas of civil society strengthening and Influencing Development Policy and Practice. We therefore undertake activities in three complementary program components. These components are supported by two functions which include; a) Results, learning and Communication and b) Corporate Services\rPolicy Advocacy and State Engagement Under this programme component, we focus on effectively coordinating NGOs engagement on multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral policy processes-NDPs, National Level Budget Analysis, Aid and Development Effectiveness, 2030 Agenda and EACamong others.\rCivic Space and governance monitoring. This component area we seek to influence internal and external operating environment issues of CSOs and ensure a positive environment for NGO operations and citizen engagement in governance processes. The focusis on coordination of NGO legislation efforts; promoting enabling environment and monitoring governance processes through initiative like the Citizen Manifesto-\rCivil Society Strengthening Under this intervention area, UNNGOF will continue to provide capacity development initiatives in several ways. These will include; work related to strengthening Boards of Directors of CSOs organizations, work with Women Leaders in civil society as well as general capacity development work for organizations.  Evaluation results of the last strategic plan indicate that there is a need for more innovation in the area ofcapacity development so that it creates more impact and is more relevant to our members and constituencies.  We shall, therefore, seek to develop initiatives with universities and other institutions of higher learning.\rWhile UNNGOF is a national platform, italso hosts the Support Program for Advocacy Networks that brings together 35 District Networks with a combined reach to 3000 civil society organizations across the country.  The infrastructure described above gives us the leverage to be able to reach millions and work with a diversity of organizations including those in underserved areas.\r\r4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING\rAnalyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? In this context, what is unique about the position ofthe organisation?\rUNNGOF operates in an environment where citizens are debased as these focus on individual politicians rather thanpublic service delivery institutions. This focus on individuals rather than institutions fuels both political patronage and elite patronage which affects quality service delivery and government accountability.\rFor civil society, these challenges constrain civil space and citizen participationin state politics and lead to the emergence of a #debased citizenry#. The effect of this individual merit hangover on Uganda#s citizen-state relationship is therefore a context that limits citizen engagement, participation and even appreciation of political diversity.\rUNNGOF has a number of partners and collaborators and these include; District Networks - collaborate in the area of programming and expanding our work to reach millions of citizens; National Networks and NGOs - collective advocacy on issues of national interest - like the National Budget, the NGO Law, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Vision 2040; Media-to amplify our voice and disseminate our issues to all partners in government and outside government; Citizen groups: Get feedbackon issues that affect their livelihood to be relayed to policy makers and implementers and Government which is a key advocacy target for our work on influencing development policies and practice.\rUNNGOF#s niche is its character. UNNGOF is a platform anda leaderincollective advocacy initiatives.  While many organizations can do policy advocacy, it takes organizations with the capacity to convene other organizations to have an impact on government policies that are nation-wide.  As a platform organization we aretherefore the #go-to# organization for Government institutions, civil society organizations, donors and citizens group that would like to generate collective positions, engage in coordinated collective advocacy and for reaching millions of citizens.  Italso plays a representational role for civil society in a number of state institutions such as   the National Planning Authority, Office of the Prime Minister implementation committees, the Accountability Sector Working Group and the  Ministry of Gender,Labour and Social Development.",

          "UGANDA NATIONAL NGO FORUM NGO FORUM",
          "Uganda National NGO Forum was launched in 1997 following two years of concerted work to develop the operational structure, a Constitution and membership recruitment program. Many NGOs had realised the need to engage Government and the donor community on policy issues and poverty concerns. Also, Government found it increasingly important to involve Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the design and implementation of policies and programmes.\rThe idea to form UNNGOF was to establish an organization that would wholly represent CSOs while bringing together National NGOs, International NGOs, CBOs, Voluntary Development Organizations (VDOs), and Farmers# Groups, Cooperative Associations and other Citizens# Organizations and interest groups from all thematic areas.\rThe first General Assembly of UNNGOF was held in January of 1997 after nationwide sensitization and mass mobilization. About 1,000 NGO representatives participated and it was agreed that the Forum would create a comprehensive membership base that would meet periodically to choose and renew leadership and other governance organs in a democratic manner. Since then, UNNGOF has never wavered in providing a platform and leadership for CSOs on behalf of the poor and through time, created a neutral ground for all NGOs to constructively interact.\rBy 2001, UNNGOF had established policies and procedures for accountability, established formal registration for members, operationaliseda code of conduct, amended the Constitution by re-mobilizing members, developed a three year rights-based Strategic Plan, and set up district forums for support at district level and to the Secretariat.\rCurrently, UNNGOF brings together 630 member organizations across the country. As a platform organization, UNNGOF has over the last 20 years UNNGOF has built capacity to convene diverse organizations to work on various collective initiatives. Further, it has also established itself as a credible partner with various government agencies where it plays a representational role forcivil society. Gender integration is an issue that we take seriously and forall our program activities we ensure that women and men are well represented.\r2. ACHIEVEMENTS\rWhat have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?\rCoordinating Civil Society Policy Advocacy\rOver the last three years, there was increased participation of civil society in policy formulation. The first ever monitoring survey of the Vision 2040 was launched in 2014 and reached over 1000 households through the national survey in all districts of Uganda. UNNGOF coordinated Civil society input in the development of the second National Development Plan and over 10 issues papers were shared with the government. UNNGOF worked closely with civil society in the post 2015 agenda that led to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals. This process reached over 4000 citizens across Uganda and civil society voice was present in the global collective messaging on the post 2015 agenda in New York as well as civil society work nationally. This work has anchored UNNGOF in the policy arena inUganda. This is evident from UNNGOF#s representational role on major policy committees in the Office of the Prime Minister, National Planning Authority and Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social development.\rSupporting the work of Sub-National Civil Society\rUNNGOFhas offered leadership to civil Society at the sub-national level through the collective organizing around civil society issues of a cross cutting nature. We have been instrumental in bringing together civil society under campaigns like Black Mondayand the development of the National Development Plan as well as linking civil society to national policy agenda. The sub-national level today boasts of several organisations that are seen as strong Civil society leaders in their regions with most of themlinked to the investmentand partnership that UNNGOF has developed through the support to Advocacy Networks infrastructure as well as the work we have continued to spearhead under the Citizen Manifesto.\rCivic engagement on Civic Space\rUNNGOF has been aproactive convener and interlocutor in many processes hat bring together Civil Society and decision makers at various levels. At the local level , the citizen manifestohas provided such a space for citizen-leader interactions. At the national level we have been instrumental in convening meetings between the Minster of Internal affairs and civil society leaders on several topical issues. These processes have created avenues for building confidence among civil society and government and political leaders on matters of mutual interest.\r\r3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE\rMission: What is the current purpose of the organisation?\r\rTo provide a sharing and reflection platform for Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) to influence governance and development processes in Uganda and enhance their operating environment.\rInstitutional objectives: What are the principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?\ra) A strong and well coordinated civil society sector with information and capacity to effectively engage in and contribute to development processes.\rb) Citizens with a greater awareness of their own situation, mobilised, informed and actively participating in policy, governance and development processes.\rc) Civic space and CSO operating environment influenced positively at the local and global level and influencing citizen engagement in governance processes.\rd) Citizen responsive government policy and practice alternatives generated through evidence building and advocacy at all levels.\re) A dynamic UNNGOF identity and presence built in Uganda and across East Africa and globally through our results, learning and communication as well imaginative knowledge brokering.\rf) Cost-efficient support to the secretariat that fosters an institutional culture of optimal re-source use that better enables UNNGOF to accomplish its objectives.\r\rField(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actors that benefit from the work?\rUNNGOF is a national platform and its work is anchored on two broad intervention areas of civil society strengthening and Influencing Development Policy and Practice. We therefore undertake activities in three complementary program components. These components are supported by two functions which include; a) Results, learning and Communication and b) Corporate Services\rPolicy Advocacy and State Engagement Under this programme component, we focus on effectively coordinating NGOs engagement on multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral policy processes-NDPs, National Level Budget Analysis, Aid and Development Effectiveness, 2030 Agenda and EACamong others.\rCivic Space and governance monitoring. This component area we seek to influence internal and external operating environment issues of CSOs and ensure a positive environment for NGO operations and citizen engagement in governance processes. The focusis on coordination of NGO legislation efforts; promoting enabling environment and monitoring governance processes through initiative like the Citizen Manifesto-\rCivil Society Strengthening Under this intervention area, UNNGOF will continue to provide capacity development initiatives in several ways. These will include; work related to strengthening Boards of Directors of CSOs organizations, work with Women Leaders in civil society as well as general capacity development work for organizations.  Evaluation results of the last strategic plan indicate that there is a need for more innovation in the area ofcapacity development so that it creates more impact and is more relevant to our members and constituencies.  We shall, therefore, seek to develop initiatives with universities and other institutions of higher learning.\rWhile UNNGOF is a national platform, italso hosts the Support Program for Advocacy Networks that brings together 35 District Networks with a combined reach to 3000 civil society organizations across the country.  The infrastructure described above gives us the leverage to be able to reach millions and work with a diversity of organizations including those in underserved areas.\r\r4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING\rAnalyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? In this context, what is unique about the position ofthe organisation?\rUNNGOF operates in an environment where citizens are debased as these focus on individual politicians rather thanpublic service delivery institutions. This focus on individuals rather than institutions fuels both political patronage and elite patronage which affects quality service delivery and government accountability.\rFor civil society, these challenges constrain civil space and citizen participationin state politics and lead to the emergence of a #debased citizenry#. The effect of this individual merit hangover on Uganda#s citizen-state relationship is therefore a context that limits citizen engagement, participation and even appreciation of political diversity.\rUNNGOF has a number of partners and collaborators and these include; District Networks - collaborate in the area of programming and expanding our work to reach millions of citizens; National Networks and NGOs - collective advocacy on issues of national interest - like the National Budget, the NGO Law, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Vision 2040; Media-to amplify our voice and disseminate our issues to all partners in government and outside government; Citizen groups: Get feedbackon issues that affect their livelihood to be relayed to policy makers and implementers and Government which is a key advocacy target for our work on influencing development policies and practice.\rUNNGOF#s niche is its character. UNNGOF is a platform anda leaderincollective advocacy initiatives.  While many organizations can do policy advocacy, it takes organizations with the capacity to convene other organizations to have an impact on government policies that are nation-wide.  As a platform organization we aretherefore the #go-to# organization for Government institutions, civil society organizations, donors and citizens group that would like to generate collective positions, engage in coordinated collective advocacy and for reaching millions of citizens.  Italso plays a representational role for civil society in a number of state institutions such as   the National Planning Authority, Office of the Prime Minister implementation committees, the Accountability Sector Working Group and the  Ministry of Gender,Labour and Social Development.",

          "UGANDA NATIONAL NGO FORUM NGO FORUM",
          "Uganda National NGO Forum was launched in 1997 following two years of concerted work to develop the operational structure, a Constitution and membership recruitment program. Many NGOs had realised the need to engage Government and the donor community on policy issues and poverty concerns. Also, Government found it increasingly important to involve Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the design and implementation of policies and programmes.\rThe idea to form UNNGOF was to establish an organization that would wholly represent CSOs while bringing together National NGOs, International NGOs, CBOs, Voluntary Development Organizations (VDOs), and Farmers# Groups, Cooperative Associations and other Citizens# Organizations and interest groups from all thematic areas.\rThe first General Assembly of UNNGOF was held in January of 1997 after nationwide sensitization and mass mobilization. About 1,000 NGO representatives participated and it was agreed that the Forum would create a comprehensive membership base that would meet periodically to choose and renew leadership and other governance organs in a democratic manner. Since then, UNNGOF has never wavered in providing a platform and leadership for CSOs on behalf of the poor and through time, created a neutral ground for all NGOs to constructively interact.\rBy 2001, UNNGOF had established policies and procedures for accountability, established formal registration for members, operationaliseda code of conduct, amended the Constitution by re-mobilizing members, developed a three year rights-based Strategic Plan, and set up district forums for support at district level and to the Secretariat.\rCurrently, UNNGOF brings together 630 member organizations across the country. As a platform organization, UNNGOF has over the last 20 years UNNGOF has built capacity to convene diverse organizations to work on various collective initiatives. Further, it has also established itself as a credible partner with various government agencies where it plays a representational role forcivil society. Gender integration is an issue that we take seriously and forall our program activities we ensure that women and men are well represented.\r2. ACHIEVEMENTS\rWhat have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?\rCoordinating Civil Society Policy Advocacy\rOver the last three years, there was increased participation of civil society in policy formulation. The first ever monitoring survey of the Vision 2040 was launched in 2014 and reached over 1000 households through the national survey in all districts of Uganda. UNNGOF coordinated Civil society input in the development of the second National Development Plan and over 10 issues papers were shared with the government. UNNGOF worked closely with civil society in the post 2015 agenda that led to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals. This process reached over 4000 citizens across Uganda and civil society voice was present in the global collective messaging on the post 2015 agenda in New York as well as civil society work nationally. This work has anchored UNNGOF in the policy arena inUganda. This is evident from UNNGOF#s representational role on major policy committees in the Office of the Prime Minister, National Planning Authority and Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social development.\rSupporting the work of Sub-National Civil Society\rUNNGOFhas offered leadership to civil Society at the sub-national level through the collective organizing around civil society issues of a cross cutting nature. We have been instrumental in bringing together civil society under campaigns like Black Mondayand the development of the National Development Plan as well as linking civil society to national policy agenda. The sub-national level today boasts of several organisations that are seen as strong Civil society leaders in their regions with most of themlinked to the investmentand partnership that UNNGOF has developed through the support to Advocacy Networks infrastructure as well as the work we have continued to spearhead under the Citizen Manifesto.\rCivic engagement on Civic Space\rUNNGOF has been aproactive convener and interlocutor in many processes hat bring together Civil Society and decision makers at various levels. At the local level , the citizen manifestohas provided such a space for citizen-leader interactions. At the national level we have been instrumental in convening meetings between the Minster of Internal affairs and civil society leaders on several topical issues. These processes have created avenues for building confidence among civil society and government and political leaders on matters of mutual interest.\r\r3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE\rMission: What is the current purpose of the organisation?\r\rTo provide a sharing and reflection platform for Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) to influence governance and development processes in Uganda and enhance their operating environment.\rInstitutional objectives: What are the principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?\ra) A strong and well coordinated civil society sector with information and capacity to effectively engage in and contribute to development processes.\rb) Citizens with a greater awareness of their own situation, mobilised, informed and actively participating in policy, governance and development processes.\rc) Civic space and CSO operating environment influenced positively at the local and global level and influencing citizen engagement in governance processes.\rd) Citizen responsive government policy and practice alternatives generated through evidence building and advocacy at all levels.\re) A dynamic UNNGOF identity and presence built in Uganda and across East Africa and globally through our results, learning and communication as well imaginative knowledge brokering.\rf) Cost-efficient support to the secretariat that fosters an institutional culture of optimal re-source use that better enables UNNGOF to accomplish its objectives.\r\rField(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actors that benefit from the work?\rUNNGOF is a national platform and its work is anchored on two broad intervention areas of civil society strengthening and Influencing Development Policy and Practice. We therefore undertake activities in three complementary program components. These components are supported by two functions which include; a) Results, learning and Communication and b) Corporate Services\rPolicy Advocacy and State Engagement Under this programme component, we focus on effectively coordinating NGOs engagement on multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral policy processes-NDPs, National Level Budget Analysis, Aid and Development Effectiveness, 2030 Agenda and EACamong others.\rCivic Space and governance monitoring. This component area we seek to influence internal and external operating environment issues of CSOs and ensure a positive environment for NGO operations and citizen engagement in governance processes. The focusis on coordination of NGO legislation efforts; promoting enabling environment and monitoring governance processes through initiative like the Citizen Manifesto-\rCivil Society Strengthening Under this intervention area, UNNGOF will continue to provide capacity development initiatives in several ways. These will include; work related to strengthening Boards of Directors of CSOs organizations, work with Women Leaders in civil society as well as general capacity development work for organizations.  Evaluation results of the last strategic plan indicate that there is a need for more innovation in the area ofcapacity development so that it creates more impact and is more relevant to our members and constituencies.  We shall, therefore, seek to develop initiatives with universities and other institutions of higher learning.\rWhile UNNGOF is a national platform, italso hosts the Support Program for Advocacy Networks that brings together 35 District Networks with a combined reach to 3000 civil society organizations across the country.  The infrastructure described above gives us the leverage to be able to reach millions and work with a diversity of organizations including those in underserved areas.\r\r4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING\rAnalyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? In this context, what is unique about the position ofthe organisation?\rUNNGOF operates in an environment where citizens are debased as these focus on individual politicians rather thanpublic service delivery institutions. This focus on individuals rather than institutions fuels both political patronage and elite patronage which affects quality service delivery and government accountability.\rFor civil society, these challenges constrain civil space and citizen participationin state politics and lead to the emergence of a #debased citizenry#. The effect of this individual merit hangover on Uganda#s citizen-state relationship is therefore a context that limits citizen engagement, participation and even appreciation of political diversity.\rUNNGOF has a number of partners and collaborators and these include; District Networks - collaborate in the area of programming and expanding our work to reach millions of citizens; National Networks and NGOs - collective advocacy on issues of national interest - like the National Budget, the NGO Law, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Vision 2040; Media-to amplify our voice and disseminate our issues to all partners in government and outside government; Citizen groups: Get feedbackon issues that affect their livelihood to be relayed to policy makers and implementers and Government which is a key advocacy target for our work on influencing development policies and practice.\rUNNGOF#s niche is its character. UNNGOF is a platform anda leaderincollective advocacy initiatives.  While many organizations can do policy advocacy, it takes organizations with the capacity to convene other organizations to have an impact on government policies that are nation-wide.  As a platform organization we aretherefore the #go-to# organization for Government institutions, civil society organizations, donors and citizens group that would like to generate collective positions, engage in coordinated collective advocacy and for reaching millions of citizens.  Italso plays a representational role for civil society in a number of state institutions such as   the National Planning Authority, Office of the Prime Minister implementation committees, the Accountability Sector Working Group and the  Ministry of Gender,Labour and Social Development.",

In 2019, NCCI will scale up work on access and field level constraints in close collaboration with the Access Working Group (AWG) while continuing to address the many other regulatory impediments. BLU will work with the authorities and other external actors to understand and communicate changing policies and practices to the NGO community. BLU will track, report and analyse NGO challenges and communicate concerns to government stakeholders. NCCI’s advocacy, knowledge management and coordination capacity will continue to help the NGO community maintain and expand humanitarian access.\r\nWhile many impediments arise unexpectedly, in 2019, BLU will prioritise NGO-oriented solutions to bureaucratic impediments, including working closely with the central and governorate-levels government and other external actors to understand and communicate changing regulatory policies and practices to the NGO community. \r\n\tAccess: Acceptance of Access Letters in federal Iraq is inconsistent and continues to pose a challenge.

        "description_narrative":["Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd from Namibia is a producer and supplier of polyethylene products as carrier bags, refuse bags, heavy duty bags, shrink sheets etc. Customers of these products are from the meat and fishing industry, the wholesale and retail industry. During the years, they have established several daughter companies and joint ventures (e.g. in South Africa).During the late 1990s, Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd expanded its activities to Angola and its daughter in Angola, Ango Plasticos Lda was established, with headquarters in Lubango (Southern Angola). Apart from that, also four branch offices for sales and distribution were established in Angola. Presently, all products sold in Angola are imported from Namibia.In order toa) meet the growing market demand,b) reduce the costs (transport and import duties) andc) become less dependent of the South African rand,the management of Ango Plasticos Lda would like to establish an own production facility in Angola (Lubango) to serve the Angolan market directly. This market (retailers, manufacturers, agricultural and fish process industries) demand more and more diversified and tailor-made packaging products.The joint venture between Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd and Ango Plasticos Lda will establish this factory about 10 km outside Lubango in the Humpata Municipal Area (ANIP Zone B) in the Huila Province in south Angola on an 18,000 m2 industrial plot owned by Ango Plasticos Lda. A new 1,000 m2 building will be constructed for the dual extrusion production lines. The maximum capacity of the new plastic packaging factory will be 1,500 tons per year (determined by the extruders).Presently, there is no local factory for the manufacturing of a variety of client-specific high quality packaging materials which is demanded by the Angolan market. The technology of dual extrusion production as intended to be used, is not yet introduced in Angola, and also not used by Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The project partners will formulate a joint CRS policy for the new company e.g. including labour issues, environmental protection, quality management procedures (ISO 9001:2008).Impact•\tEmployment and working conditionsApart from local laws, all members of staff will receive free transport to and from work. Free meals will be provided during working hours. Personal health and hygiene training will be provided to all by a local health organisation contracted by the company. In case workers are ill, they will also have access to the medical services and care of this organisation.Members of staff, wishing to follow a training that will enhance their professional capacities, will be supported by the company. The costs of the course or training programme will be covered.•\tInnovation / Transfer of knowledgeAlthough the bulk of the products might not be new for the country, since it is imported by the local partner, the production process is innovative, especially dual extrusion. In addition to that, the quality of the productions will be improved.•\tChain effectsThe local shareholder will no longer be dependent on supply by road from Namibia, and will not have to pay import duties. It will be able to purchase the joint venture's new materials that can be marketed.Raw materials will still be imported since they are not available in Angola, other supplies e.g. carton, transports services will be sourced locally.•\tImpact on the sectorThe company might be an example for the local plastic sector: it will be the first one being ISO certified and the first one that recycles the waste produced during the process.•\tEnvironmentPlastic in the environment is a negative aspect, however the project partners are aware of that and will recycle plastic as much as possible. They will also start up awareness campaigns and cleaning campaigns as they do in Namibia.•\tPosition of womenAbout 50% of the medium-/high-level staff will be female. The production process itself does not encourage woman to participate in the process so the number of basic-skilled women involved might be low.",
          "The project will result in the establishment of a manufacturing plant of high quality plastic packaging. The factory will initially produce four types of products for Angola: carrier bags and other plastic bags, high quality shrink film, drums (printed),"],

        "description_narrative":["Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd from Namibia is a producer and supplier of polyethylene products as carrier bags, refuse bags, heavy duty bags, shrink sheets etc. Customers of these products are from the meat and fishing industry, the wholesale and retail industry. During the years, they have established several daughter companies and joint ventures (e.g. in South Africa).During the late 1990s, Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd expanded its activities to Angola and its daughter in Angola, Ango Plasticos Lda was established, with headquarters in Lubango (Southern Angola). Apart from that, also four branch offices for sales and distribution were established in Angola. Presently, all products sold in Angola are imported from Namibia.In order toa) meet the growing market demand,b) reduce the costs (transport and import duties) andc) become less dependent of the South African rand,the management of Ango Plasticos Lda would like to establish an own production facility in Angola (Lubango) to serve the Angolan market directly. This market (retailers, manufacturers, agricultural and fish process industries) demand more and more diversified and tailor-made packaging products.The joint venture between Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd and Ango Plasticos Lda will establish this factory about 10 km outside Lubango in the Humpata Municipal Area (ANIP Zone B) in the Huila Province in south Angola on an 18,000 m2 industrial plot owned by Ango Plasticos Lda. A new 1,000 m2 building will be constructed for the dual extrusion production lines. The maximum capacity of the new plastic packaging factory will be 1,500 tons per year (determined by the extruders).Presently, there is no local factory for the manufacturing of a variety of client-specific high quality packaging materials which is demanded by the Angolan market. The technology of dual extrusion production as intended to be used, is not yet introduced in Angola, and also not used by Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The project partners will formulate a joint CRS policy for the new company e.g. including labour issues, environmental protection, quality management procedures (ISO 9001:2008).Impact•\tEmployment and working conditionsApart from local laws, all members of staff will receive free transport to and from work. Free meals will be provided during working hours. Personal health and hygiene training will be provided to all by a local health organisation contracted by the company. In case workers are ill, they will also have access to the medical services and care of this organisation.Members of staff, wishing to follow a training that will enhance their professional capacities, will be supported by the company. The costs of the course or training programme will be covered.•\tInnovation / Transfer of knowledgeAlthough the bulk of the products might not be new for the country, since it is imported by the local partner, the production process is innovative, especially dual extrusion. In addition to that, the quality of the productions will be improved.•\tChain effectsThe local shareholder will no longer be dependent on supply by road from Namibia, and will not have to pay import duties. It will be able to purchase the joint venture's new materials that can be marketed.Raw materials will still be imported since they are not available in Angola, other supplies e.g. carton, transports services will be sourced locally.•\tImpact on the sectorThe company might be an example for the local plastic sector: it will be the first one being ISO certified and the first one that recycles the waste produced during the process.•\tEnvironmentPlastic in the environment is a negative aspect, however the project partners are aware of that and will recycle plastic as much as possible. They will also start up awareness campaigns and cleaning campaigns as they do in Namibia.•\tPosition of womenAbout 50% of the medium-/high-level staff will be female. The production process itself does not encourage woman to participate in the process so the number of basic-skilled women involved might be low.",
          "The project will result in the establishment of a manufacturing plant of high quality plastic packaging. The factory will initially produce four types of products for Angola: carrier bags and other plastic bags, high quality shrink film, drums (printed),"],

        "description_narrative":["Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd from Namibia is a producer and supplier of polyethylene products as carrier bags, refuse bags, heavy duty bags, shrink sheets etc. Customers of these products are from the meat and fishing industry, the wholesale and retail industry. During the years, they have established several daughter companies and joint ventures (e.g. in South Africa).During the late 1990s, Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd expanded its activities to Angola and its daughter in Angola, Ango Plasticos Lda was established, with headquarters in Lubango (Southern Angola). Apart from that, also four branch offices for sales and distribution were established in Angola. Presently, all products sold in Angola are imported from Namibia.In order toa) meet the growing market demand,b) reduce the costs (transport and import duties) andc) become less dependent of the South African rand,the management of Ango Plasticos Lda would like to establish an own production facility in Angola (Lubango) to serve the Angolan market directly. This market (retailers, manufacturers, agricultural and fish process industries) demand more and more diversified and tailor-made packaging products.The joint venture between Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd and Ango Plasticos Lda will establish this factory about 10 km outside Lubango in the Humpata Municipal Area (ANIP Zone B) in the Huila Province in south Angola on an 18,000 m2 industrial plot owned by Ango Plasticos Lda. A new 1,000 m2 building will be constructed for the dual extrusion production lines. The maximum capacity of the new plastic packaging factory will be 1,500 tons per year (determined by the extruders).Presently, there is no local factory for the manufacturing of a variety of client-specific high quality packaging materials which is demanded by the Angolan market. The technology of dual extrusion production as intended to be used, is not yet introduced in Angola, and also not used by Plastic Packaging (Pty) Ltd.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The project partners will formulate a joint CRS policy for the new company e.g. including labour issues, environmental protection, quality management procedures (ISO 9001:2008).Impact•\tEmployment and working conditionsApart from local laws, all members of staff will receive free transport to and from work. Free meals will be provided during working hours. Personal health and hygiene training will be provided to all by a local health organisation contracted by the company. In case workers are ill, they will also have access to the medical services and care of this organisation.Members of staff, wishing to follow a training that will enhance their professional capacities, will be supported by the company. The costs of the course or training programme will be covered.•\tInnovation / Transfer of knowledgeAlthough the bulk of the products might not be new for the country, since it is imported by the local partner, the production process is innovative, especially dual extrusion. In addition to that, the quality of the productions will be improved.•\tChain effectsThe local shareholder will no longer be dependent on supply by road from Namibia, and will not have to pay import duties. It will be able to purchase the joint venture's new materials that can be marketed.Raw materials will still be imported since they are not available in Angola, other supplies e.g. carton, transports services will be sourced locally.•\tImpact on the sectorThe company might be an example for the local plastic sector: it will be the first one being ISO certified and the first one that recycles the waste produced during the process.•\tEnvironmentPlastic in the environment is a negative aspect, however the project partners are aware of that and will recycle plastic as much as possible. They will also start up awareness campaigns and cleaning campaigns as they do in Namibia.•\tPosition of womenAbout 50% of the medium-/high-level staff will be female. The production process itself does not encourage woman to participate in the process so the number of basic-skilled women involved might be low.",
          "The project will result in the establishment of a manufacturing plant of high quality plastic packaging. The factory will initially produce four types of products for Angola: carrier bags and other plastic bags, high quality shrink film, drums (printed),"],

        "description_narrative":["5 to 10 years ago, the government of fragile state The Gambia heavily promoted the cultivation of mangos which has led to the current abundance of mangos and price droppings. A lack of market access opportunities, combined with inefficiencies in the mango chain, has resulted in extremely high crop losses for farmers during the short (4 months) mango season, challenging their livelihoods.Tradin is currently one of the world’s biggest suppliers of organic dried mango which are imported from West Africa (amongst others). In order to meet world-wide growing demand for dried mangos, the company aimed to develop an organic dried mango value chain and increase production in The Gambia by investing in its young local partner Tropingo Foods. Technical Assistance (DGGF) is used to invest in the set-up of an organic supply chain, additional equipment and drying facilities, improvement of quality- and operational processes within the facility and a feasibility study for a large scale factory and mango plantation. The project is the first to process mango and the first ‘organic’ project in the country. It supported 200+ direct jobs (80 FTE) and 256 indirect jobs of smallholder farmers in the supply chain. Both, the employees in the processing facility as the mango farmers, received training on good manufacturing practices and good agricultural practices, including organic production and these farmers are now cultivating according to international organic standards leading to new income streams. As a result of the Technical Assistance, the factory is now an approved vendor and certified supplier of dried mangos. Further investments are currently being explored and may result in the creation of more than 500 new jobs in the next few years."],

        "description_narrative":["5 to 10 years ago, the government of fragile state The Gambia heavily promoted the cultivation of mangos which has led to the current abundance of mangos and price droppings. A lack of market access opportunities, combined with inefficiencies in the mango chain, has resulted in extremely high crop losses for farmers during the short (4 months) mango season, challenging their livelihoods.Tradin is currently one of the world’s biggest suppliers of organic dried mango which are imported from West Africa (amongst others). In order to meet world-wide growing demand for dried mangos, the company aimed to develop an organic dried mango value chain and increase production in The Gambia by investing in its young local partner Tropingo Foods. Technical Assistance (DGGF) is used to invest in the set-up of an organic supply chain, additional equipment and drying facilities, improvement of quality- and operational processes within the facility and a feasibility study for a large scale factory and mango plantation. The project is the first to process mango and the first ‘organic’ project in the country. It supported 200+ direct jobs (80 FTE) and 256 indirect jobs of smallholder farmers in the supply chain. Both, the employees in the processing facility as the mango farmers, received training on good manufacturing practices and good agricultural practices, including organic production and these farmers are now cultivating according to international organic standards leading to new income streams. As a result of the Technical Assistance, the factory is now an approved vendor and certified supplier of dried mangos. Further investments are currently being explored and may result in the creation of more than 500 new jobs in the next few years."],

        "description_narrative":["5 to 10 years ago, the government of fragile state The Gambia heavily promoted the cultivation of mangos which has led to the current abundance of mangos and price droppings. A lack of market access opportunities, combined with inefficiencies in the mango chain, has resulted in extremely high crop losses for farmers during the short (4 months) mango season, challenging their livelihoods.Tradin is currently one of the world’s biggest suppliers of organic dried mango which are imported from West Africa (amongst others). In order to meet world-wide growing demand for dried mangos, the company aimed to develop an organic dried mango value chain and increase production in The Gambia by investing in its young local partner Tropingo Foods. Technical Assistance (DGGF) is used to invest in the set-up of an organic supply chain, additional equipment and drying facilities, improvement of quality- and operational processes within the facility and a feasibility study for a large scale factory and mango plantation. The project is the first to process mango and the first ‘organic’ project in the country. It supported 200+ direct jobs (80 FTE) and 256 indirect jobs of smallholder farmers in the supply chain. Both, the employees in the processing facility as the mango farmers, received training on good manufacturing practices and good agricultural practices, including organic production and these farmers are now cultivating according to international organic standards leading to new income streams. As a result of the Technical Assistance, the factory is now an approved vendor and certified supplier of dried mangos. Further investments are currently being explored and may result in the creation of more than 500 new jobs in the next few years."],

          "NGO Forums mål är att bidra till att förbättra förutsättningarna för att de stora utvecklingsmässiga och humanitära behoven i Södra Sudan ska kunna mötas. För att uppnå detta stödjer NGO Forum samordning, kommunikation, påverkansarbete, kapacitetsutveckling, samt säkerhetssamarbete bland det stora antal NGOs som levererar social service och bidrar till fred och säkerhet i landet. NGO Forum representerar även alla icke-statliga organisationer, både lokala och internationella, i södra Sudan. Det är Sidas bedömning att NGO Forums verksamhet, som utformats av medlemmarna under många års samarbete, är relevant, effektiv och motsvarar behoven i en föränderlig och synnerligen utmanande kontext. Det är Sidas bedömning att NGO Forums sekretariat har erfoderlig kapacitet att fortsätta genomföra dess aktiviteter, samt att Tearfund (som administratör för sekreteriatet) utgör en tillförlitlig samarbetspartner."],

        "description_narrative":["Somalia remains in a state of a complex humanitarian emergency characterised by multifaceted factors including volatile political environment, extreme poverty, food insecurity, conflict and instability. Over 3.1 million people are in humanitarian emergency and crisis, 6.2 million people in need of assistance and 1.1 million people in protracted internal displacement. The operating environment in Somalia remains volatile and challenging and access to those in need continues to be impeded by a range of factors culminating to the already stressful working environment and debilitating humanitarian partners from providing timely assistance to vulnerable populations. Humanitarian organisations have continued to report significant increases in bureaucratic impediments particularly in Puntland and southern Somalia. The Consortium continues to advocate for favourable working environment for NGOs to deliver aid to those in need through its core activities of coordination, representation, advocacy and information sharing. Development of press releases/position papers further expresses NGOs voices and concerns and acts as advocacy tools to raise awareness, in particular media awareness, on the plight of Somalis with a focus on thematic issues. It is believed that these communiques influence decisions. Moreover, frequent visits to Mogadishu and in key Regional State capitals (Garowe, Baidoa and Kismayo) are paramount to advocate for amicable solutions to arising administrative impediments. In June 2014, the NGO Consortium commissioned a study on Risk Management amp Accountability (RMA) practices among NGOs in Somalia to map out and analyse NGO standards and approaches in risk management and mitigation in Somalia and Somaliland. NGO Consortium members identified common approaches to mitigating risks, capacity building on risk management and developed guidelines on common risk management standards. NGOs agreed to openly and honestly appraise their risk management methods that they practiced as well as share information with other NGOs to enhance transparency and encourage information sharing among NGOs. Members then endorsed these “Guidelines (Code of Conduct) for RMA practices for NGOs operating in Somalia/Somaliland”. The Consortium anticipates hiring a consultant to conduct an evidence-based assessment of NGO compliance and implementation of the risk management guidelines with a view to identifying the effectiveness of risk management systems to continue to build momentum towards strengthening risk management approaches. Moreover, the aim of this assessment is to check the relevance and possibly revise the guidelines to suit the current Somalia situation. As the key coordination mechanism for local and international NGOs working in Somalia on a wide range of issues and sectors, the Consortium continues to reiterate the crucial role played by NGOs to address need while adapting to the changing context in Somalia, advocating for the interests of Somalis both inside and outside Somalia, looking beyond emergency response to promote aid effectiveness while supporting the development of Somali NGOs’ capacity and increasing their accountability to communities and donors. The Consortium anticipates facilitating a durable solutions roundtable discussion with key players with the aim to generate dialogue on plausible solutions to the large scale and protracted refugee situations in Somalia as well as capacity building for NGOs on Access Negotiation and a course on Introduction to Working in Somalia. Though the humanitarian development nexus discourse may be at its infant stage, it is essential to strengthen linkages between humanitarian and development activities in order to create and maintain lasting solutions to Somalia’s dependence on humanitarian aid, a notion desired by the current government."],

        "description_narrative":["Somalia remains in a state of a complex humanitarian emergency characterised by multifaceted factors including volatile political environment, extreme poverty, food insecurity, conflict and instability. Over 3.1 million people are in humanitarian emergency and crisis, 6.2 million people in need of assistance and 1.1 million people in protracted internal displacement. The operating environment in Somalia remains volatile and challenging and access to those in need continues to be impeded by a range of factors culminating to the already stressful working environment and debilitating humanitarian partners from providing timely assistance to vulnerable populations. Humanitarian organisations have continued to report significant increases in bureaucratic impediments particularly in Puntland and southern Somalia. The Consortium continues to advocate for favourable working environment for NGOs to deliver aid to those in need through its core activities of coordination, representation, advocacy and information sharing. Development of press releases/position papers further expresses NGOs voices and concerns and acts as advocacy tools to raise awareness, in particular media awareness, on the plight of Somalis with a focus on thematic issues. It is believed that these communiques influence decisions. Moreover, frequent visits to Mogadishu and in key Regional State capitals (Garowe, Baidoa and Kismayo) are paramount to advocate for amicable solutions to arising administrative impediments. In June 2014, the NGO Consortium commissioned a study on Risk Management amp Accountability (RMA) practices among NGOs in Somalia to map out and analyse NGO standards and approaches in risk management and mitigation in Somalia and Somaliland. NGO Consortium members identified common approaches to mitigating risks, capacity building on risk management and developed guidelines on common risk management standards. NGOs agreed to openly and honestly appraise their risk management methods that they practiced as well as share information with other NGOs to enhance transparency and encourage information sharing among NGOs. Members then endorsed these “Guidelines (Code of Conduct) for RMA practices for NGOs operating in Somalia/Somaliland”. The Consortium anticipates hiring a consultant to conduct an evidence-based assessment of NGO compliance and implementation of the risk management guidelines with a view to identifying the effectiveness of risk management systems to continue to build momentum towards strengthening risk management approaches. Moreover, the aim of this assessment is to check the relevance and possibly revise the guidelines to suit the current Somalia situation. As the key coordination mechanism for local and international NGOs working in Somalia on a wide range of issues and sectors, the Consortium continues to reiterate the crucial role played by NGOs to address need while adapting to the changing context in Somalia, advocating for the interests of Somalis both inside and outside Somalia, looking beyond emergency response to promote aid effectiveness while supporting the development of Somali NGOs’ capacity and increasing their accountability to communities and donors. The Consortium anticipates facilitating a durable solutions roundtable discussion with key players with the aim to generate dialogue on plausible solutions to the large scale and protracted refugee situations in Somalia as well as capacity building for NGOs on Access Negotiation and a course on Introduction to Working in Somalia. Though the humanitarian development nexus discourse may be at its infant stage, it is essential to strengthen linkages between humanitarian and development activities in order to create and maintain lasting solutions to Somalia’s dependence on humanitarian aid, a notion desired by the current government."],

Wealth for some but wide-spread poverty for the vast majority combined with special challenges of the most vulnerable groups of society and major environmental problems (deforestation impact of climate change pollution due to extracti\r\non of natural resources) are some of the major challenges over the next decade. In this process of change civil society organisations have an important role to play firstly as advocates of the most vulnerable people and on changes needed in terms of policy\r\n and implementation and secondly as service providers for vulnerable groups who are without care. However the capacity of NGOs remains low especially in terms of ability to perform advocacy work. There is a need to further increase the capacity and profess\r\nionalism of NGOs and to strengthen their coordination and cooperation.Key aim of the CISUNET project is to achieve socially and ecologically sustainable development and reduction of poverty. While the first phase (2008-2010) and second  phase (2011-2013) p\r\nrioritized on strengthening the working capacity and networking of local NGOs the third phase (2014-2016) will precedence strengthening the advocacy element of NGO work. It will increase the capability of Tanzanian civil society via community-based NGOs an\r\nd umbrella NGO TACOSODE to influence policy and decision-making towards reduction of poverty and inequality and to perform advocacy work to improve the situation and rights of the most vulnerable groups (women children people with disabilities people livin\r\ng with HIV/AIDS elderly people unemployed youths etc.). Further the project increases the capacity and networking of Tanzanian NGOs among NGOs themselves and between NGOs and the public and private sectors on a local national and international level. It pr\r\nomotes understanding on issues of globalisation and development among social and health NGOs in Finland and internationally via the global umbrella organisation ICSW thus promoting North-South cooperation. Means of intervention are assessment of local NGOs\r\n, training workshops and seminars, regional national and international awareness-raising, provision of IT equipment and internet access to NGO networks."],

However the capacity of NGOs remains low especially in terms of ability to perform advocacy work. There is a need to further increase the capacity and profess\r\nionalism of NGOs and to strengthen their coordination and cooperation.Key aim of the CISUNET project is to achieve socially and ecologically sustainable development and reduction of poverty. While the first phase (2008-2010) and second  phase (2011-2013) p\r\nrioritized on strengthening the working capacity and networking of local NGOs the third phase (2014-2016) will precedence strengthening the advocacy element of NGO work. It will increase the capability of Tanzanian civil society via community-based NGOs an\r\nd umbrella NGO TACOSODE to influence policy and decision-making towards reduction of poverty and inequality and to perform advocacy work to improve the situation and rights of the most vulnerable groups (women children people with disabilities people livin\r\ng with HIV/AIDS elderly people unemployed youths etc.). Further the project increases the capacity and networking of Tanzanian NGOs among NGOs themselves and between NGOs and the public and private sectors on a local national and international level. It pr\r\nomotes understanding on issues of globalisation and development among social and health NGOs in Finland and internationally via the global umbrella organisation ICSW thus promoting North-South cooperation. Means of intervention are assessment of local NGOs\r\n, training workshops and seminars, regional national and international awareness-raising, provision of IT equipment and internet access to NGO networks."],

The support is a continuation of prev Swedish support since 2012.",
          "Tearfund har ansökt Sidamedel om 4,9 MSEK för att fortsätta bedriva NGO Forum Secretariat i Sydsudan 2015-2016. Sekretariatets övergripande mål är att skapa bättre förutsättningar för civilsamhällsorganisationer att möta de utvecklingsmässiga och humanitära behoven som präglar landet. NGO Forum spelar en viktig roll som koordinator och påverkansaktör för både nationella och internationella icke-statliga organisationer (NGO:er) verksamma i Sydsudan. För närvarande består forumet av ca 145 internationella och 200 nationella medlemsorganisationer. Forumet styrs av årligt utvalda styrkommittéer och koordineras bland annat genom olika tematiska arbetsgrupper; påverkan, säkerhet, personal/HR och kapacitetsutveckling. Genom samordning och informationsspridning är syftet att skapa ett bättre klimat för NGO:er att verka i landet. \r\n\r\nDet är Sidas bedömning att NGO Forums verksamhet, som utformats av forumets medlemmar under många års samarbete, är relevant, effektivt och motsvarar behoven i en föränderlig och synnerligen utmanande kontext. Det är Sidas bedömning att NGO Forums sekretariat har erforderlig kapacitet att fortsätta genomföra dess aktiviteter, samt att Tearfund (som administratör för sekretariatet) utgör en tillförlitlig samarbetspartner. Bedömningen görs utifrån Sidas tidigare erfarenheter av stöd till NGO Forum med Tearfund som samarbetspartner. \r\n\r\nInsatsens totala budget är ca 10 MSEK, varav 49 % är stöd från Sida och 38 % från andra givare (ECHO & SDC). NGO Forum Sekretariatet står själva för 13 % som beräknas komma in genom bland annat medlemsavgifter. \r\n\r\nSidas förra stöd till Tearfund avslutades i augusti 2015 och Tearfund har i sin begäran ansökt om nya medel för perioden 1 september 2015 till 31 augusti 2016. Ansökan ankom emellertid Sida först i september och slutlig rapportering för tidigare fas färdigställdes under oktober och november. Ett större glapp i den svenska, enda helt icke-öronmärkta finanseringen till NGO Forums sekretariat, skulle dock påverka verksamheten negativt. Det föreslås därför att Sida godkänner delvis retroaktivt stöd till insatsen för perioden 1 oktober 2015 till 30 september 2016."],

        "description_narrative":["(Rwanda):  USAID's Ingobyi activity (Ingobyi refers to a cushion to carry infants or sick people), provides technical assistance at all levels of Rwanda's health system to improve the capacity of health professionals to prevent maternal and child deaths. The activity is focused in 20 of Rwanda's 30 districts. Ingobyi will train, mentor and supervise doctors, nurses and midwives to improve clinical competencies in antenatal care; emergency obstetric and newborn care; management of childhood illnesses; family planning; infection control and prevention; and management of sexual and gender-based violence at the facility level.  At the community level, Ingobyi will train and supervise community health workers to correctly diagnose and treat malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and provide reproductive health services.  Ingobyi will improve the quality of data captured in the Health Management Information System and its use in decision making. Ingobyi will also support social and behavior change interventions to improve adoption of healthy reproductive maternal, child and adolescent health behaviors, including hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, and malaria. .Rwanda's pre-service medical system is weak and lacks experienced professionals to provide ongoing clinical mentorship. Ingobyi therefore partners with the Government of Rwanda and local medical professional associations that will continue to provide ongoing in-service training to raise the overall clinical competencies of providers, in order to build a more professional cadre of medical providers. .Ingobyi's focus on improving healthcare directly contributes to the Mission's Development Objective 1 of improved health outcomes and overall goal of strengthening human capital.  .. .. ... ."],
