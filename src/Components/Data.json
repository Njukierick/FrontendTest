          "The proposed operation is a loan to the Republic of Seychelles for USD 10 million to finance the COVID-19 emergency response support program. This is a Crisis Response Budget Support (CRBS) that will be applied for 12 months from June 2020 to July 2021. The Seychelles Crisis Response Budget Support operation was appraised from 20 – 27 April 2020 following a request from the Republic of Seychelles dated 8 April 2020. Seychelles faces a dual challenge of addressing short term impact of COVID-19 and setting the course for a higher growth trajectory. The first case of COVID-19 in Seychelles was confirmed on 14th March and by the 6th of April, there were 11 confirmed imported cases. The country has attained universal health coverage (UHC) with the State providing free and universal access to health care for all Seychellois. However, COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse these gains and risks the sustainability of Seychelles universal health coverage. Cognizant of this threat, the Government is implementing measures under the COVID-19 National Response Plan, which have been effective in preventing community transmissions. The operation is to support Government actions that will lay the foundation for macroeconomic stability and protect the socioeconomic progress that the country has so far achieved. The program consists of three broad components namely: (i) strengthening the health response for COVID-19; (ii) expanding social protection and protecting livelihoods against COVID-19 impact; and (iii) protecting economic activities and safeguarding jobs against COVID-19 shocks. These three components are interlinked in pursuit of addressing the immediate public health challenge of saving lives, expanding social protection mechanisms as well as cushioning businesses and the economy from downward spiral.",
          "La présente interventionporte sur un prêt de 10 millions d’USD à la République des Seychelles pour financer le programme d’appui à la riposte d’urgence à la COVID-19. Il s’agit d’un appui budgétaire en réponse à la crise (ABRC) qui s’étendra sur 12 mois, de juin 2020 à juillet 2021. L’appui budgétaire pour la réponse aux crises aux Seychelles été évaluée du 20 au 27 avril 2020 suite à une demande de la République des Seychelles datée du 8 avril 2020. Les Seychelles sont confrontées à un double défi consistant à atténuer l’impact à court terme de la COVID 19 et à définir la voie à suivre pour se placer sur une trajectoire de plus forte croissance. Le premier cas de COVID-19 a été confirmé aux Seychelles le 14 mars et 11 cas importés avaient été confirmés au 6 avril, aucun décès n’étant enregistré. Le pays est parvenu à une couverture médicale universelle, l’État offrant un accès gratuit et uniforme aux soins de santé à tous les Seychellois. La pandémie de COVID-19 menace toutefois de réduire à néant les progrès réalisés par le système de santé publique, car une pandémie généralisée et prolongée pourrait entraîner des dépenses de santé élevées et compromettre la viabilité de la couverture sanitaire universelle. Conscient de cette menace, le gouvernement met en œuvre, dans le cadre du plan national de riposte à la COVID-19, des mesures qui ont été efficaces pour prévenir les transmissions communautaires. L’opération est destinée à appuyer les mesures gouvernementales qui jetteront les bases de la stabilité macroéconomique, et à préserver les avancées socio-économiques réalisées jusqu’ici par le pays. Le programme comprend trois composantes générales, à savoir : i) renforcer la riposte sanitaire à la COVID-19?; ii) étendre la protection sociale et préserver les moyens de subsistance contre l’impact de la COVID-19?; et iii) protéger les activités économiques et préserver les emplois contre les chocs de la COVID-19. Ces trois composantes sont étroitement liées pour relever le défi immédiat de santé publique consistant à sauver des vies, à étendre les mécanismes de protection sociale et à protéger les entreprises et l’économie contre la spirale descendante.",

The policy objective of the operation is to; (i) strengthen the health response to COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) protect livelihoods and enhance social protection measures against COVID19, and; (iii) minimize risk to macroeconomic stability and create resilience for economic activities.",

L’objectif stratégique visé par l’opération est i) de renforcer la riposte sanitaire à la pandémie de COVID-19 et d’arrêter la propagation de nouvelles infections, ii) de protéger les moyens de subsistance et de renforcer les mesures de protection sociale contre la COVID-19, et iii) de réduire au minimum le risque pour la stabilité macroéconomique et de rendre résilientes les activités économiques.",
          "The program will protect the population from the spread of COVID19 especially men who are epidemiologically more susceptible and enhanced fiscal space for improved basic service delivery. The poor and vulnerable whose livelihoods have been affected by the pandemic will directly benefit through strengthened livelihoods and expanded social protection coverage. Employees in the private sector will also benefit through the government’s salary guarantee scheme. Maintained macroeconomic stability supported by the program will directly benefit households, the private sector and financial sector actors through faster and more inclusive economic recovery on the back of more resilient businesses and workforce.",
          "Le programme protégera la population de la propagation du COVID-19, en particulier des hommes qui sont épidémiologiques plus sensibles, et améliorera l’espace fiscal pour améliorer la prestation des services de base. La population sera protégée contre les effets de la pandémie de COVID-19. Les pauvres et les personnes vulnérables dont les moyens de subsistance ont été touchés par la pandémie en profiteront directement, grâce au renforcement des moyens de subsistance et à l’extension de la couverture de protection sociale. Les employés du secteur privé tireront aussi parti du système de garantie des salaires mis en place par le gouvernement. Le maintien de la stabilité macroéconomique qu’appuie le programme profitera directement aux ménages, au secteur privé et aux acteurs du secteur financier, grâce à l’accélération et à une inclusivité accrue de la reprise économique, favorisées par le renforcement de la résilience des entreprises et de la main-d’œuvre."

          "The Ethiopia COVID-19 Crisis Response Budget Support (ECRBS) program aims to support the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia’s NERP to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate the economic and social impacts of the COVID19 pandemic on local businesses and vulnerable households, particularly the urban poor. Indeed, Ethiopia ranks among the few sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries that have halved poverty within a decade. As of end May 2020, 1,172 cases of COVID-19 had been reported in country, with 209 recoveries and 11 deaths. The impact of COVID-19 on Ethiopia’s economy is likely to be significant and may reverse some economic progress achieved. The operation consists of a UA 120 million grant from the country’s ADF-15 Performance Based Allocation to finance the Ethiopian Government’s COVID-19 National Emergency Response Plan (NERP). This is a Crisis Response Budget Support provided in compliance with the Bank Group’s COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility (CRF), approved by the Boards of the Bank and the Fund on 8th April 2020. This program consists of three broad mutually reinforcing components: (i) supporting the health sector response to COVID-19, (ii) supporting the social sector response program against COVID-19 and (iii) safeguarding economic resilience against the after-effects of COVID-19 shocks.",
          "Le Programme d’appui budgétaire pour la riposte à la COVID-19 en Éthiopie (ECRBS) vise essentiellement à soutenir le Plan national de riposte d’urgence (NERP) de la République fédérale démocratique d’Éthiopie pour enrayer la propagation de la maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) et en atténuer les impacts économiques et sociaux sur les entreprises locales et les ménages vulnérables, et singulièrement sur les populations pauvres vivant dans les centres urbains. En effet, l’Éthiopie est l’un des rares pays d’Afrique subsaharienne à avoir réduit de moitié son taux de pauvreté en dix ans. À la fin du mois de mai 2020, en tout 1 172 cas de COVID-19 avaient été recensés dans le pays, au nombre desquels 209 cas guéris et 11 décès. L’impact de la COVID19 sur l’économie éthiopienne pourrait être important et compromettre certains progrès réalisés sur le plan économique. L’opération consiste en un don de 120 millions d’UC, de l'allocation du FAD-15 basée sur la performance, pour financer en partie le Plan national de riposte d’urgence à la COVID-19 (NERP). Il s’agit d’un appui budgétaire réalisé pour appuyer la riposte à la crise, conformément à la Facilité de réponse rapide à la COVID-19 (CRF) mise en place par le Groupe de la Banque et approuvée par les Conseils d’administration de la Banque et du Fonds le 8 avril 2020. Cette opération comporte les trois grandes composantes ci-après, qui se renforcent mutuellement : i) appui à la riposte du secteur de la santé à la COVID-19 ; ii) appui au Programme de riposte du secteur social à la COVID-19 ; et iii) renforcement de la résilience économique contre les répercussions de la COVID-19.",
          "The goal of the program is to support the NERP, Ethiopia’s response plan to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes strengthening of healthcare service preparedness and response, protection of livelihoods, especially for the vulnerable, and support to private sector enterprises. Consistent with the response plan, the overall operational objective of the proposed operation is to support the implementation of measures to ensure that the country’s healthcare and social protection systems, fiscal position and economy are sufficiently supported to mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "Le Programme a pour objectif de soutenir le NERP, le plan de riposte de l’Éthiopie à la pandémie de COVID-19, qui prévoit le renforcement de la préparation et de la riposte des services de santé, la protection des moyens de subsistance, en particulier pour les personnes vulnérables, et le soutien aux entreprises du secteur privé. Conformément au plan de riposte, l’objectif opérationnel global de l’opération proposée est d’accompagner la mise en œuvre de mesures visant à s’assurer que les systèmes de soins de santé et de protection sociale, la situation fiscale et l’économie du pays sont suffisamment soutenus pour atténuer les effets négatifs de la pandémie de COVID-19.",
          "The program will benefit the Ethiopian people by contributing to protection of macroeconomic stability and supporting a more inclusive economic recovery. The direct beneficiaries from the program are households, private sector, financial sector actors and recipients of social protection grants, including orphans, the elderly, persons with disability and the urban poor. The program measures will also support strengthening capacity and expansion of health systems in order to improve and strengthen basic service delivery.",
          "Le Programme profitera au peuple éthiopien en contribuant à la protection de la stabilité macroéconomique et en soutenant une reprise économique plus inclusive. Les bénéficiaires directs du Programme sont les ménages, le secteur privé, les acteurs du secteur financier et les bénéficiaires de subventions de protection sociale, en particulier les orphelins, les personnes âgées, les personnes handicapées et les pauvres vivant en milieu urbain. En outre, les mesures du Programme soutiendront le renforcement des capacités et l’expansion des systèmes de santé afin d’améliorer la prestation des services de base."

          "The proposed operation is an ADF-15 grant of UA 18.75 million and TSF Pillar I grant of UA 1.25 million to the Republic of Sudan to finance operations of the Federal Ministry of Health of Sudan in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) pandemic across the country. The operation is aligned with Government of Sudan development objectives and COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan. It was appraised in June 2020 following a request from the Government of Sudan dated May 08, 2020. Indeed, Sudan experienced late transmission of COVID-19 and reported its first case on March 14, 2020. The numbers increased to 13,555 cases (6,759 recovered) and 836 deaths as at September 21, 2020. The project complements other COVID-19 response support that the Bank is providing to the East African Community (EAC), the InterGovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) under the auspices of the African Union (AU). The Sudan COVID-19 CRF will cover four components implemented at national and local levels. Its expected outcomes are enhanced capacity for treatment and care of COVID-19 patients; enhanced (national) capacity for testing, and surveillance for COVID-19; and heightened community awareness. The project will be implemented over one and half years (2020/2022) and its expected outcomes are enhanced capacity to contain COVID-19 and respond to future pandemics.",
          "La présente intervention porte sur un don de 18,75 millions d’UC du FAD-15 et de 1,25 million d’UC du Pilier I de la FAT à la République fédérale du Soudan pour financer les opérations du ministère fédéral de la Santé en réponse à la pandémie de coronavirus (COVID-19) dans le pays. L’opération s’inscrit dans la ligne des objectifs de développement du gouvernement du Soudan et du plan de préparation et de réponse à la COVID-19. Elle a été évaluée en juin 2020 à la suite d’une demande du gouvernement du Soudan datée du 8 mai 2020. En effet, le Soudan a connu une transmission tardive de la COVID-19 et a signalé son premier cas le 14 mars 2020. Les chiffres sont passés à 13 555 cas (6 759 cas guéris) et 836 décès au 21 septembre 2020. Le projet complète les autres mesures de riposte à la pandémie de maladie à coronavirus 2019 offertes par la Banque par l’intermédiaire de la CAE, de l’IGAD et du Centre africain de contrôle et prévention des maladies (CDC) par l’intermédiaire de l’Union africaine. La CRF de la COVID-19 au Soudan couvrira quatre composantes mises en œuvre aux plans national et local. Les résultats escomptés sont l’amélioration des capacités de traitement et de soins des patients de la COVID-19, l’amélioration des capacités (nationales) de dépistage et de surveillance de la COVID-19 et la sensibilisation des communautés. Le projet sera mis en œuvre sur une période d’un an et demi (2020/2022) et devrait permettre de renforcer la capacité à contenir la COVID-19 et à répondre aux futures pandémies.",
          "The goal of this project is to strengthen the health systems of Sudan to contain the COVID19 pandemic and build resilience to respond to future pandemics including climate-induced outbreaks. The project will support the Sudan COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response plan in the following areas: (a) strengthen health systems and build resilience to respond to COVID-19 crisis and other pandemics taking into consideration the fragility of the country; (b) strengthen the laboratory testing and surveillance capacity; and (c) enhance community engagement and risk communication and positive health.",
          "L’objectif de ce projet est de contribuer au « renforcement des systèmes de santé afin de contenir la pandémie de COVID-19 et de renforcer la résilience pour répondre aux futures pandémies, y compris les éclosions induites par le climat ». Le projet appuiera le plan de préparation et de réponse à la pandémie de COVID-19 au Soudan dans les domaines suivants : a) renforcer les systèmes de santé et développer la résilience pour répondre à la crise de COVID-19 et à d’autres épidémies en tenant compte de la fragilité du pays ; b) renforcer les capacités de surveillance et d’analyse en laboratoire ; et c) améliorer l’engagement communautaire et la communication des risques et la santé positive.",
          "The direct beneficiaries of the program will be: (i) Sudan population who will benefit from improved access PHC services; (ii) the healthcare workers who will be trained on COVID-19 prevention and case management protocols; (iii) health workers in targeted health facilities (receive PPEs and reduced infection rates); (iv) the vulnerable and marginalized groups; and (v) positive cases who are critically affected by the disease. The indirect beneficiaries will be population in the 8 neighboring countries (subSaharan Africa and Arab world).",
          "Les bénéficiaires directs du projet seront : i) la population soudanaise qui bénéficiera d’un meilleur accès aux services de soins de santé primaires ; ii) les travailleurs de la santé qui seront formés aux protocoles de prévention et de gestion des cas de COVID-19 ; iii) les travailleurs de la santé des établissements de santé ciblés (qui recevront des EPI et bénéficieront d’une réduction des taux d’infection) ; iv) les groupes vulnérables et marginalisés ; et v) les cas positifs qui sont gravement touchés par la maladie. Les bénéficiaires indirects seront les populations des 8 pays voisins (Afrique subsaharienne et monde arabe)."

The purpose of this funding is to provide support to ZCCB to prepare for a coordinated COVID19 multi-sectoral response through the following (1)Provide risk communication information for COVID19 prevention and containment; and, (2) Capacity strengthening of front line health workers in Catholic health facilities and faith leaders on COVID19. \r\n\r\nThe COVID19 situation in Zambia worsened since the first wave that was recorded in March 2020. Incidences of new cases of COVID19 have escalated in both the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths since the second wave of the new strain of COVID19. Unlike the first wave which was mild, this surge in cases was further accompanied by an increase in the severity of the disease requiring hospitalization and oxygen therapy. With the increased levels of COVID19, ZCCB has adapted and designed some activities that will help the Catholic Church to support communities to respond to the new COVID variant."

          "Le Zimbabwe est actuellement confronté à des problèmes supplémentaires de vulnérabilité causés par la pandémie du COVID-19, qui touche désormais la quasi-totalité des pays du monde. L’opération proposée vise à atténuer l’impact de la pandémie du COVID-19, tout particulièrement en mettant à disposition du matériel et des fournitures médicales ainsi qu’en formant des intervenants de première ligne ciblés et en offrant des installations de lavage des mains. Le projet proposé vient en réponse à la demande présentée par le gouvernement zimbabwéen à la Banque en mars 2020 et s’inscrit dans le cadre des efforts déployés par la Banque et le gouvernement pour relever les énormes défis liés au COVID-19 auxquels le pays est confronté, en particulier dans les zones urbaines et périurbaines. Calendrier d’exécution : 2 ans, soit de 2020 à 2022. Le coût total du projet est de 11,11 millions d’UC. Les résultats escomptés sont a) l’amélioration de l’indice de sécurité sanitaire mondial du Zimbabwe, b) le renforcement des compétences des populations des régions ciblées en matière de protocoles de prévention et de gestion du COVID-19, et c) l’élargissement de l’accès aux installations de lavage des mains pour la protection contre le COVID-19 à Harare, dans les petites agglomérations satellites et dans d’autres régions touchées par le COVID-19.",
          "Zimbabwe is currently facing additional vulnerability challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is now affecting practically every country in the world. The proposed operation aims to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in supply of medical equipment and supplies as well as training of targeted frontline responders and provision of handwashing facilities. The proposed project is in response to the Government of Zimbabwe’s (GoZ’s) request submitted to the Bank in March 2020 and it is consistent with the Bank’s and the GoZ’s efforts to address the enormous COVID-19-related challenges facing the country, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas. Implementation timeframe: 2 years, 2020-2022 and the total project cost is UA 11.11 million. The expected outcomes are: (a) improved Global Health Security Index for Zimbabwe; (b) increased skills in COVID-19 prevention and management protocols for populations in targeted regions; and (c) increased access to COVID-19 hand washing facilities in Harare, satellite townships and other COVID-19 affected regions.",
          "The objective of the project is to contribute to limiting the morbidity and the mortality rates related to COVID-19 in Zimbabwe through the strengthening of the health system to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The indirect beneficiaries will include all the 680,000 population of the targeted suburbs and townships.",
          "Les bénéficiaires  directs  sont  principalement  i)  les  populations  des  banlieues urbaines  à  forte  densité  ciblées  d’Harare  et  des  petites  agglomérations satellites, qui jouiront d’un meilleur accès aux installations de lavage des mains ; ii) les 4 500 agents de santé communautaires et villageois qui seront formés aux  protocoles  de  prévention  du  COVID-19  et  de  gestion  des  cas —60  % d’entre eux seront des femmes se trouvant en première ligne de la prestation de  soins  communautaires  ;  et  iii)  les  médecins  et  le  personnel  infirmier  des établissements de santé ciblés, qui bénéficieront d’EPI et tireront parti de la baisse  des  taux  d’infection.  Les  bénéficiaires indirects   comprendront l’ensemble des 680 000 habitants des petites agglomérations et des banlieues ciblées."

          "The steep increase of COVID-19 cases in the Gaza Strip during April 2021, increased the pressure on the health system and further compromised the fragile living positions of the most vulnerable families.\r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to respond to the current peak of COVID-19 infection, alleviate the most urgent needs of vulnerable families, and contribute to limit the destabilizing effects of the current public health emergency in the Gaza Strip.\r\n\r\nThe intervention will reinforce the immediate response of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the Gaza Strip to prevent and treat the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic through procurement of essential COVID-19 medical supplies including, ICU and ultra-cold chain equipment for COVID-19 vaccines to the designated health facilities.\r\n\r\nThe project will respond to the two key components of the Health Cluster Response Plan, namely a) to support MoH to stop the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 and provide adequate care for patients affected by COVID-19, their families, and close contacts b) to Strengthening and Scale-up MoH capacity to early detect and respond to COVID-19 outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe allocation is a critical emergency response to provide support to around five health care facilities (HCF) in the Gaza Strip which have been designated by the MoH to be used for treating patients from COVID-19.  In addition, the medical central store and designated health facility will be equipped with ultra–cold chain equipment to store properly the COVID 19 vaccine. \r\n\r\nThese facilities lack adequate medical equipment needed to ensure safe and proper case management of COVID-19 patients. They also lack the ultra-cold chain equipment which is required to ensure the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. This will feed into the work currently being undertaken by UNICEF with MoH and WHO with regards to rollout of COVID-9 vaccination aimed at increasing vaccine uptake across the country."

          "The steep increase of COVID-19 cases in the Gaza Strip during April 2021, increased the pressure on the health system and further compromised the fragile living positions of the most vulnerable families.\r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to respond to the current peak of COVID-19 infection, alleviate the most urgent needs of vulnerable families, and contribute to limit the destabilizing effects of the current public health emergency in the Gaza Strip.\r\n\r\nThe intervention will reinforce the immediate response of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the Gaza Strip to prevent and treat the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic through procurement of essential COVID-19 medical supplies including, ICU and ultra-cold chain equipment for COVID-19 vaccines to the designated health facilities.\r\n\r\nThe project will respond to the two key components of the Health Cluster Response Plan, namely a) to support MoH to stop the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 and provide adequate care for patients affected by COVID-19, their families, and close contacts b) to Strengthening and Scale-up MoH capacity to early detect and respond to COVID-19 outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe allocation is a critical emergency response to provide support to around five health care facilities (HCF) in the Gaza Strip which have been designated by the MoH to be used for treating patients from COVID-19.  In addition, the medical central store and designated health facility will be equipped with ultra–cold chain equipment to store properly the COVID 19 vaccine. \r\n\r\nThese facilities lack adequate medical equipment needed to ensure safe and proper case management of COVID-19 patients. They also lack the ultra-cold chain equipment which is required to ensure the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. This will feed into the work currently being undertaken by UNICEF with MoH and WHO with regards to rollout of COVID-9 vaccination aimed at increasing vaccine uptake across the country."

          "The proposed intervention concerns the Mali component of the COVID-19 Crisis Response Programme in the G5 Sahel Countries (PARC COVID-19 – G5 SAHEL). This is a loan and award a grant to the G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad) of UA 118.9 million and UA 89.6 million respectively from the COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility. It will be implemented over 12 months from July 2020. The Programme was appraised in April 2020 following requests to the Bank by the countries. The first COVID-19 case in Mali was reported on 25 March 2020 and by 5 June 2020, the total number of cases stood at 1,461. To contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mali took several preventive and protection measures including (i) the closure of all land borders, (ii) the suspension of commercial flights from COVID-19-affected countries until further notice, except for cargo flights, (iii) the temporary closure of public, private and denominational schools (nursery, primary, secondary and tertiary) and (iv) the ban, till further notice, of social, sports and political gatherings of over 50 persons. These measures caused a slump in economic demand and supply, leading to an abrupt and widespread economic slowdown. This Programme complements the other budget support operations, particularly the Multinational Coronavirus Pandemic Control Support Project for G5 member countries approved on 9 June 2020, aimed at providing the region with adequate operational capacities to combat the pandemic. More specifically, the programme will contribute to the financing of response plans through the budget support it will provide. It will also support measures aimed at improving the financial management of the response plans and mitigating the health, social and economic-related impacts.",
          "La présente intervention concerne la composante malienne du Programme d’appui en réponse à la crise de la COVID-19 dans les pays du G5 sahel (PARC COVID-19 – G5 SAHEL). Il s'agit d'une opération de prêt et don aux pays du G5 Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritanie, Niger, Tchad) respectivement de 118,9 millions d’UC et 89,6 millions d’UC de la Facilité de réponse rapide à la COVID-19. Elle sera mise en œuvre sur une période de 12 mois à partir de juillet 2020. Le programme a été évalué en avril 2020, à la suite des demandes adressées par les pays à la Banque. Au Mali, le premier cas de personne contaminée par la COVID-19 a été déclaré le 25 mars 2020. Au 5 juin 2020, le pays enregistrait un total de 1461 cas. Pour contenir la propagation de la pandémie de la COVID-19, le Mali a pris plusieurs mesures de prévention et de protection comme : (i) la fermeture de toutes les frontières terrestres ; (ii) la suspension jusqu’à nouvel ordre, des vols commerciaux en provenance des pays touchés par la COVID-19, à l’exception des vols cargos ; (iii) la fermeture temporaire des écoles publiques, privées et confessionnelles (maternelles, primaires, secondaires et supérieures) ; et (iv) l’interdiction jusqu’à nouvel ordre, des regroupements à caractère social, sportif, culturel et politique de plus de 50 personnes. Ces mesures ont engendré une forte contraction de l’offre et de la demande économiques, conduisant ainsi à un brusque ralentissement général de l’économie malienne. Le Programme vient en complément des autres appuis de la Banque, notamment le Projet multinational d’appui en faveur des pays membres du G5 sahel pour la lutte contre la pandémie a coronavirus approuvé le 9 juin 2020, qui vise à doter la région de capacités opérationnelles pour faire face à la pandémie. De manière spécifique, le Programme contribuera au financement des plans de riposte grâce aux aides budgétaires qu’il apporte. Il soutiendra également des mesures visant une meilleure gestion financière des plans de riposte, et une atténuation des impacts de la pandémie au plan sanitaire, social et économique.",
          "The programme’s global objective is to help to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mali. It aims specifically to (i) build health capacity to fight against COVID-19, (ii) mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable persons and (iii) mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19.",
          "Le programme a pour objectif global de contribuer à l’atténuation de l’incidence de la pandémie de la COVID-19 au Mali. Il vise spécifiquement : (i) le renforcement des capacités sanitaires de lutte contre la pandémie de la COVID-19 ; (ii) l’atténuation de l’incidence sur les personnes vulnérables de la pandémie de la COVID-19 ; et (iii) l’atténuation de l’incidence économique de la pandémie de la COVID-19.",
          "The whole population of Mali will benefit from this programme since it will help to mitigate the health and socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population and reduce the economic shock on enterprises hit by the economic downturn induced by the pandemic. Thanks to the programme, the capacity of Mali’s public administration will be built to marshal the health response, protect the most vulnerable segments of the population and support economic activity. All these elements will help to build the resilience and inclusive character of the Malian economy.",
          "Toute la population malienne bénéficiera du présent programme. Il permettra d’atténuer les impacts sanitaires et socio-économiques de la pandémie de la COVID-19 sur la population. Il contribuera également à réduire le choc économique sur les entreprises victimes du fort ralentissement de l’économie résultant de la pandémie. Par ailleurs, grâce à ce programme, les capacités de l’administration publique malienne seront renforcées en matière de riposte sanitaire, de protection des couches les plus vulnérables de la population et de soutien à l’activité économique. Tous ces éléments contribueront à renforcer la résilience et le caractère inclusif de l’économie malienne."

          "New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\rWHO AFRO has applied to Sweden for funding of 80 million SEK to carry out the \" Country Level AFRO Reform (DCL): From COVID to HEALTH), which is divided into two pillars. Pillar 1: COVID-19 implications on essential health service delivery (i.e., SRHR) and mitigating the risk of system collapse\" and pillar two “Coordinated Strategic and Policy Support for Structural and Functional Transformation of WHO Country Offices.” The programme will be implemented between 1 July 2020 and 31 December 2021. Sida will contribute 30 Million SEK to pillar one and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) will contribute 50 million SEK to pillar two. \n\nThe funding will be used to strengthen and amplify the convening power, influence, and mandate of the WHO/AFRO to offer quality and timely technical support to the focus countries. More specifically, this Grant will allow WHO/AFRO to support the focus countries in achieving the following outcomes:\n\n1. Maintained continuity of essential high-quality SRHR information and services through a health system approach, including preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence\n2. Increased access to a wider range of contraceptive methods (expanded method mix) through Task Sharing and self-care interventions\n3. Strengthened monitoring system for tracking progress in SRHR/Family Planning.\n\nThis investment will enable WHO-AFRO to contribute to components of its Transformation Agenda 2015-2020—pro-results values, smart technical focus; responsive strategic operations; and effective communication and partnerships in the SRHR workspace. It will also contribute to the Regional WHO transformation aiming at understanding the country’s priorities as well as the type and level of support required and align WHO country presence to the Member States and partner expectations (linked to Pillar II).\n\nWHO AFRO will implement the contribution in close coronation with 2Gether4SRHR (ID: 10596), in particular the agreement amended (ZAM-DC19/2020). The total budget of the contribution is 80 Million SEK, where Sida contributes 30 MSEK and the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs 50 MSEK (Decision UD2020/08919/IU, UD2020/01985/FN) .\n\nThe contribution is in line with the Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak.",
          "Nya medel/medeltillägg för att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19\rKonsekvenserna av covid-19 pandemin för låg- och medelinkomstländer riskerar bli katastrofala både vad gäller hälsoutfall och för den sociala och ekonomiska utvecklingen. I slutet av juni 2020 var antalet bekräftade fall av covid-19, som orsakas av coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), drygt 8,8 miljoner och 465 000 personer har avlidit. Afrika har än så länge relativt få fall, men WHO:s Regionkontor för Afrika (AFRO) uppskattar att 22 procent av befolkningen på den afrikanska kontinenten kommer att smittas under pandemins första år, vilket kan komma att resultera i 190 000 dödsfall. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) har nyligen publicerat en analys som visar att covid-19 Afrikas pandemi har haft samma utveckling under de första 150 dagarna som de kontinenter som drabbats tidigare. \n\nUtöver direkta hälsokonsekvenserna av covid-19 visar ett antal prognoser att krishanteringen kan komma att tränga undan grundläggande hälso- och sjukvårdsinsatser, inklusive sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter (SRHR). Dessutom riskerar covid-19 responsen att finansiera punktinsatser istället för att beakta helhetsbehov och bygga motståndskraftiga system för att möjliggöra återhämtning. Erfarenhet från Ebola-epidemin visade att gravida kvinnors tillgång till mödrahälsovård minskade med förhöjd mödradödlighet som konsekvens. Tidiga uppgifter från covid-19 drabbade länder i regionen visar till exempel en ökning med 30% i antalet ärenden om könsrelaterat våld. Nyckelgrupper är särskilt sårbara på grund av minskat försörjning, stigma och diskriminering. Sida ser därmed en stor risk resultaten i Sveriges regionala SRHR strategi riskerar att påverkas negativt, vilket föranlett behovet av att stödja den kontinentala covid-19 responsen, med fokus på de indirekta effekterna av pandemin på SRHR.\n\nDen 22 februari 2020 hölls ett krismöte med alla Afrikas 55 hälsoministrar/ hälsoministerier vilket resulterade i en kontinental strategi mot covid-19. Sydafrikas president, i egenskap av ordförande för Afrikanska Unionen, godkände strategin tillsammans med den byrå som bistår ordföranden, för närvarande presidenterna från Mali, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Egypten och Kenya. Den kontinentala covid-19 strategin Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak har två övergripande mål: 1) att förebygga svår sjukdom och död av coronavirusinfektion i medlemsländer och 2) att minimera sociala och ekonomiska konsekvenser av covid-19 utbrottet\n\nMålsättningarna ska uppnås via två huvudsakliga arbetsspår: att samordna covid-19 responsen mellan medlemsländer, AU:s organ och WHO, och andra partners för att säkerställa synergier och att minska risker för dubbelarbete samt genom att främja evidensbaserade folkhälsostrategier för övervakning (surveillance), förebyggande arbete, diagnos, behandling och kontroll av covid-19.\n\nStrategin implementeras genom Africa Task Force for Coronavirus (AFTCOR), där Africa CDC, FN och AU:s medlemsländer leder arbetsgrupper, och genom Africa CDC’s Incident Management System (IMS). Ett antal partners, både FN och ickestatliga aktörer, bidrar också till att implementera strategin. Dessa implementerande partners finansieras antingen direkt av biståndsgivare som finansierar kompletterande\ninsatser, eller via Africa CDC som sedan vidareförmedlar medel till implementerande partners. Ett tillägg finns även till strategin, AU COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan Addendum to the African Union COVID-19- Continental Strategy, som inkluderar specifik referens till att säkerställa tillgång till grundläggande hälsosjukvård, inklusive mödrabarnhälsovård under covid-19 pandemin.\n\nSida kommer att bidra till Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak genom två nya insatser och en avtalsändring av en pågående insats, 2Gether4SRHR (insats ID: 10596, beslutsnummer ZAM-DC19/2020). De två nya insatserna är till Africa CDC om SEK 20 000 000 och till WHO AFRO om SEK 30 000 000. Sida ser på insatserna som tre delar av ett sammanhållet stöd i linje med ovan nämnda strategi, dvs Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak.\n\nWHO AFRO har sökt om finansiering för programmet Country Level AFRO Reform (DCL): From COVID to HEALTH (2020–2021), som är uppdelat på två pelare. Pelare ett: COVID-19 implications on essential health service delivery (i.e., SRHR) and mitigating the risk of system collapse och pelare två: Coordinated Strategic and Policy Support for Structural and Functional Transformation of WHO Country Offices under perioden 1 juli 2020 till 31 december 2021. Sida kommer att finanserna pelare ett med 30 miljoner SEK och UD finansiera pelare två med 50 Miljoner SEK (Beslut UD2020/08919/IU, UD2020/01985/FN). Den totala volymen är 80 miljoner SEK. Insatsen finansieras via en s.k. pooled fund som administreras av WHO AFRO, som är avtalspart. Aktiviteterna under pelare ett kommer att genomföras inom WHO AFRO regionen, med följande fokusländer: Sierra Leone, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Kamerun, Nigeria, Centralafrikanska Republiken och Demokratiska Republiken Kongo och genom stärkt kapacitet för samordning på det WHO:s regionala kontor för AFRO-regionen i Brazzaville.",
          "The objectives of the intervention have not been changed.\nThis intervention supports the WHO AFRO implementation of the Country Level AFRO Reform (DCL): From COVID to HEALTH, \"Pillar 1: COVID-19 implications on essential health service delivery (i.e., SRHR) and mitigating the risk of system collapse\". \nThe initiative will strengthen and amplify the convening power, influence, and mandate of the WHO AFRO to offer quality and timely technical support to focus countries, in order to achieve the following outcomes:\n1. Maintained continuity of essential high-quality SRHR information and services through a health system approach, including preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence\n2. Increased access to a wider range of contraceptive methods (expanded method mix) through Task Sharing and self-care interventions\n3. Strengthened monitoring system for tracking progress in SRHR/Family Planning.\nAdditional funding to Pillar 2 “Coordinated Strategic and Policy Support for Structural and Functional Transformation of WHO Country Offices” is channeled trough the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs."

          "With over 18 million cases of COVID-19, India is reeling under an unprecedented health emergency with the continuing surge in the number of COVID-19 cases and related deaths. The country’s infection rate began to rise in February 2021 and has been on an upward surge since early April. India recorded over 386,452 fresh cases of COVID-19 on 30th April 2021, taking the country’s total tally to 18,762,976 and the total death toll to 208,330. \n The increasing number of cases of COVID-19 is severely crippling health care systems, which are already overburdened beyond limits. Severe shortages of hospital beds and oxygen have led to hundreds of people dying without being able to receive the necessary treatment. Cremation and burial grounds, in many parts of the country, are also overwhelmed by the number of deaths. Life-saving medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are also in short supply across the country. So far, over 147 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered across India. However, the increasing infection rate and shortage in the manufacture and supply of vaccines are posing serious challenges in rolling out vaccines for everyone. \n This devastating coronavirus surge in India has resulted in the DEC COVID-19 Appeal being extended to include India on 28 April 2021 and, as of this date, all donations received will be used to respond to the crisis in India. In response, WV India will be developing an emergency project to respond to the current COVID-19 health crisis that is claiming 100's of thousands of lives.\n In summary: This will be implemented in 13 locations in South India and achieve the following under each of the above mentioned outcomes:\n Outcome 1:\n \n Output: Increased awareness of communities on COVID-19 appropriate behaviours.  \n \n \n Indicator: 65,000 people reached through mass awareness campaigns  \n \n \n Activity: Context appropriate mass community awareness programmes on COVID-19 behaviour protocols in 13 Area Programme locations (Malappuram, Palakkad, Thiruvananthapuram, Bellary, Yadgir, Hyderabad, Perambalur, Marungapuri, Viruthu Nagar, Rajapalayam, Ramanathapuram, Nandyal, Nirmal).  \n  \n Outcome 2:\n \n Output 1:  COVID-19 treatment hospitals at Block and District levels have received oxygen concentrators  \n \n \n Output 2: Covid-19 treatment hospitals at Block and District levels have received medical beds, bedsheet, pillow and PPE kits.  \n \n \n Indicators: \n \n \n \n \n 8 Block level Community Health Centres, 3 District Hospitals and one MCH medical receive infrastructure support  \n \n \n 65 oxygen concentrator sets provided to hospitals (5 each for 8 Block Hospitals, 6 each for 3 District Hospitals and 7 for the Medical College Hospital) \n \n \n \n  \n \n Activity: Provide infrastructure support (medical bed, oxygen concentrators and PPE kits to Block and District level government hospitals and a Medical College).  \n  \n Outcome 3:\n \n Output 1: Psychosocial care provided to 1200 most vulnerable children and families in 12 Area Programme locations.  \n \n \n Indicator: 1200 children & parents received psychosocial support through counselling  \n \n \n Activity: Provide psychosocial care to most vulnerable children and families through counselling support.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n Output 2: Most vulnerable COVID-19 affected families received cash transfer assistance as an immediate relief.  \n \n \n Indicator: 4,574 most vulnerable COVID-19 affected families received financial assistance through cash transfer programme \n \n  \n \n Activity: Cash transferred to 4,574 COVID-19 affected families to meet their immediate essential family needs."

          "On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC). The Emergency Committee has also provided recommendations to WHO, to all countries, and to the global community, on measures to control the outbreak. On the 11 March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, affecting 123 countries and territories.  On 5 March, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) reported its first 7 confirmed COVID-19 cases to WHO - a cluster of hotel workers in Bethlehem who were in contact with a Greek tourist group which tested positive for COVID-19 upon their return to Greece. Since then, MoH reported 37 more confirmed cases bringing the total number to 44 (as of 18-Mar-2020, 10:00am). Cases have now been reported in Bethlehem, Tulkarm, Nablus and Ramallah. The MoH has also reported the community transmission of the virus as family members of the first detected had also been tested positive for COVID-19.\r\n\r\nSince the first cases were reported globally, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and partners have been gradually expanding the support to the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health (MoH) to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. These efforts intensified since the first reported cases in oPt. The overall objective of this project is to support the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health (PA MoH) to stop the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 and provide adequate care for patients affected by COVID-19, their families and close contacts. The project aims to accelerate the strengthening and scaling-up of the MoH capacity to prevent, early detect and respond to COVID-19 outbreak. WHO will support the MoH in: (1) procuring and delivering the PPE supplies, (2) supporting MoH's efforts in scaling-up COVID-19 case management, especially in Gaza focussing on ensuring the ability of the health system to treat COVID-19 cases, including critical ones, and expanding laboratory support. As part of the inter-agency risk communication and community engagement task force, WHO will support collective efforts to educate and actively communicate with the public and reaching the population with tailored messaging through community engagement and interpersonal communication approaches. WHO estimates that up to 5,000 women and men in OpT will have access to adequate COVID-19 treatment, up to 600 patients will have COVID-19 tests and communities in all 5 Gaza governorates will have received communication messages for prevention of COVID-19 (up to 500,000 men and women). Additionally up to 500 health workers will benefit from capacity building activities and up to 65 health facilities will benefit from infection prevention and control supplies."

          "On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC). The Emergency Committee has also provided recommendations to WHO, to all countries, and to the global community, on measures to control the outbreak. On the 11 March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, affecting 123 countries and territories.  On 5 March, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) reported its first 7 confirmed COVID-19 cases to WHO - a cluster of hotel workers in Bethlehem who were in contact with a Greek tourist group which tested positive for COVID-19 upon their return to Greece. Since then, MoH reported 37 more confirmed cases bringing the total number to 44 (as of 18-Mar-2020, 10:00am). Cases have now been reported in Bethlehem, Tulkarm, Nablus and Ramallah. The MoH has also reported the community transmission of the virus as family members of the first detected had also been tested positive for COVID-19.\r\n\r\nSince the first cases were reported globally, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and partners have been gradually expanding the support to the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health (MoH) to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. These efforts intensified since the first reported cases in oPt. The overall objective of this project is to support the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health (PA MoH) to stop the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 and provide adequate care for patients affected by COVID-19, their families and close contacts. The project aims to accelerate the strengthening and scaling-up of the MoH capacity to prevent, early detect and respond to COVID-19 outbreak. WHO will support the MoH in: (1) procuring and delivering the PPE supplies, (2) supporting MoH's efforts in scaling-up COVID-19 case management, especially in Gaza focussing on ensuring the ability of the health system to treat COVID-19 cases, including critical ones, and expanding laboratory support. As part of the inter-agency risk communication and community engagement task force, WHO will support collective efforts to educate and actively communicate with the public and reaching the population with tailored messaging through community engagement and interpersonal communication approaches.

Health service providers (Doctors & Nurses), Community Health Workers (CHWs) & Volunteers will be provided with capacity building training on COVID-19 Infection, Prevention & Control (IPC) mechanism as well as home-based care. Training will be also provided to faith based religious leaders (Imam) on misbelief and rumours related to COVID-19. Thus, the Imam, considered a trusted source of information, will play vital role in tackling rumours by disseminating approved messaging on Covid-19. CHW and community volunteers will visit households in the targeted areas, identify and referring suspected cases of COVID-19 to laboratory/booth for testing.",

          "On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC). The Emergency Committee has also provided recommendations to WHO, to all countries, and to the global community, on measures to control the outbreak. On the 11 March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. On 5 March, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) reported its first 7 confirmed COVID-19 cases to WHO. Since then, MoH has reported a cumulative total of 43,345 confirmed cases, with 12,803 active cases across the oPt (as of 17-Sep-2020, 22:00hrs). Regrettably, 278 people died due to COVID-19. The first four local cases were detected within the community in the Gaza Strip on August 25, when the family members of a patient who developed COVID-19 symptoms after being referred to Jerusalem, tested positive as well. Local authorities in the Gaza Strip have so far reported a total of 2,176 confirmed cases, out of which 1,756 are still active cases (as of 17-Sep-2020,22:00hrs). \r\n\r\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and partners have been gradually expanding the support to the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health (MoH) to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. These efforts intensified since the first reported cases in oPt. The overall objective of this project is to support the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health (PA MoH) to contain the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19. The project aims to strengthen and scale-up the capacity to early detect COVID-19 and adequately trace contacts of confirmed cases. WHO will support the PA MoH and Gaza health authorities in: (1) procuring and delivering essential supplies and equipment needed to scale-up laboratory testing for COVID-19 and expanding laboratory support (3) scaling-up MOH capacity in COVID-19 case detection and management through training health workers. WHO estimates that up to 70,000 women and men in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will have access to adequate COVID-19 screening through laboratory testing. An additional 100 health workers in Gaza would benefit from the provision of capacity building on COVID-19 case management. At least 500,000 Palestinians in Gaza would receive public health messages on how to prevent COVID-19 through social media, printed messages, etc. \r\n\r\nThe project will also maintain a coordination mechanism established by WHO oPt on a temporary basis to reinstate a centralized mechanism to support patients and companions required by Israel to submit permit applications in order to reach essential health services in the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory. This temporary mechanism established following the suspension of coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel after a series of consultations with the Humanitarian Coordinator is aligned with the PA Ministry of Health’s referrals system ensures oversight and monitoring of patient and companion permit delays and denials and signposts patients facing delays or denials of permits to appeals processes and advocacy organizations. An estimated 1,200 male and female Gaza patients/companions would benefit.\r\n\r\nThis allocation would contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the inter-agency COVID-19 response plan launched on 27 March, revised 28 August as well as the Health Cluster Gaza Immediate Needs Plan launched 28 August 2020. It is also in line with the Palestinian National COVID-19 Response Plan launched by the PM’s office on 26 March 2020."

          "The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to 213 countries and 2 cruise ships. There are 5,900,527 COVID-19 cases across the world: 2,577,181 recovered and 361,764 have died (Worldometer, Coronavirus, May 27, 2020). COVID-19 is an unprecedented global emergency, both in terms of the scale of public health preparedness and response, as well as its broader social and economic impacts due to associated lockdowns, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.\r\n\r\nThe urgent COVID-19 health response in Jordan negatively affects the capacity of the health system to respond to the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated health needs of the population. NCDs are the leading cause of mortality in Jordan, accounting to almost 80% of all deaths (World Health Organization, Jordan Health Profile). Equally, the economic consequences of COVID-19 and NCDs are massive due to the combined healthcare costs and lost economic productivity from the lockdown due to COVID-19, NCDs, and premature deaths caused by COVID-19 and NCDs. Current and projected repercussions from COVID-19 and an uncontrolled NCD burden on vulnerable host communities, specifically refugee populations, requires an urgent, enhanced, enlarged, integrated health system response, and development of a robust NCDs programme in Jordan. \r\n\r\nThe Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) will prioritize the Health sector in this project proposal, based on its previous experience with Healthy Community Clinic (HCC) program since 2011 providing NCDs prevention and care and recent COVID-19 national campaign, as well as local consultations with the Ministry of Health (MOH), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Health Organization (WHO), its partners, international and national non-governmental organizations (INGOs/NGOs), The project will support saving lives, alleviate suffering, and increase access to humanitarian assistance for vulnerable People with Special Needs, such as People Living With NCDs (PLWNCDs), NCD patients, elderly people at risk, Syrian refugees, refugees of other nationalities, and vulnerable Jordanians, inclusive of people with disabilities, prioritizing female-head households, incorporating gender mainstreaming, when possible. RHAS will provide safe and effective clinical care for NCD patients through care for individuals who are at the highest risk for poor outcomes, ensure that older patients, patients with comorbid conditions, and other vulnerable people are prioritized. The project’s interventions will be multi-sectoral, with the aim to prevent and control COVID-19 and NCDs to foster a healthy societal environment, in which people are encouraged to make and maintain healthy living choices promote health literacy so that people can protect and improve their health build the capacity of health care providers provide health services focused on early detection of COVID-19, cost-effective management of NCDs and their risk factors respond to the specific needs of vulnerable groups with NCDs affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and keeping communities as protected as possible from the impact of COVID-19 and NCDs. To maximize the project's impact, the project activities will address critical needs in the Health sector and address the needs of healthcare providers, prioritizing areas with the highest needs, complementing sector projects and interventions in targeted geographical areas (primarily north and central governorates of Jordan), to support coherence and added value. The implementation of the project would promote a focus on COVID-19 and NCDs by the public health system in Jordan, specifically at primary care and community levels, whereby COVID-19 and NCDs are prevented and managed for refugee populations and Jordanians through an integrated national response. This would be embedded within the idealized transition towards ‘universal health coverage’ for all, galvanized by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

          "On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC). The Emergency Committee has also provided recommendations to WHO, to all countries, and to the global community, on measures to control the outbreak. On the 11 March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. On 5 March, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) reported its first 7 confirmed COVID-19 cases to WHO. Since then, MoH has reported a cumulative total of 43,345 confirmed cases, with 12,803 active cases across the oPt (as of 17-Sep-2020, 22:00hrs). Regrettably, 278 people died due to COVID-19. The first four local cases were detected within the community in the Gaza Strip on August 25, when the family members of a patient who developed COVID-19 symptoms after being referred to Jerusalem, tested positive as well. Local authorities in the Gaza Strip have so far reported a total of 2,176 confirmed cases, out of which 1,756 are still active cases (as of 17-Sep-2020,22:00hrs). \r\n\r\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and partners have been gradually expanding the support to the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health (MoH) to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. These efforts intensified since the first reported cases in oPt. The overall objective of this project is to support the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health (PA MoH) to contain the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19. The project aims to strengthen and scale-up the capacity to early detect COVID-19 and adequately trace contacts of confirmed cases. WHO will support the PA MoH and Gaza health authorities in: (1) procuring and delivering essential supplies and equipment needed to scale-up laboratory testing for COVID-19 and expanding laboratory support (3) scaling-up MOH capacity in COVID-19 case detection and management through training health workers. WHO estimates that up to 70,000 women and men in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will have access to adequate COVID-19 screening through laboratory testing. An additional 100 health workers in Gaza would benefit from the provision of capacity building on COVID-19 case management. At least 500,000 Palestinians in Gaza would receive public health messages on how to prevent COVID-19 through social media, printed messages, etc. \r\n\r\nThe project will also maintain a coordination mechanism established by WHO oPt on a temporary basis to reinstate a centralized mechanism to support patients and companions required by Israel to submit permit applications in order to reach essential health services in the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory. This temporary mechanism established following the suspension of coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel after a series of consultations with the Humanitarian Coordinator is aligned with the PA Ministry of Health’s referrals system ensures oversight and monitoring of patient and companion permit delays and denials and signposts patients facing delays or denials of permits to appeals processes and advocacy organizations. An estimated 1,200 male and female Gaza patients/companions would benefit.\r\n\r\nThis allocation would contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the inter-agency COVID-19 response plan launched on 27 March, revised 28 August as well as the Health Cluster Gaza Immediate Needs Plan launched 28 August 2020. It is also in line with the Palestinian National COVID-19 Response Plan launched by the PM’s office on 26 March 2020."

          "The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to 213 countries and 2 cruise ships. There are 5,900,527 COVID-19 cases across the world: 2,577,181 recovered and 361,764 have died (Worldometer, Coronavirus, May 27, 2020). COVID-19 is an unprecedented global emergency, both in terms of the scale of public health preparedness and response, as well as its broader social and economic impacts due to associated lockdowns, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.\r\n\r\nThe urgent COVID-19 health response in Jordan negatively affects the capacity of the health system to respond to the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated health needs of the population. NCDs are the leading cause of mortality in Jordan, accounting to almost 80% of all deaths (World Health Organization, Jordan Health Profile). Equally, the economic consequences of COVID-19 and NCDs are massive due to the combined healthcare costs and lost economic productivity from the lockdown due to COVID-19, NCDs, and premature deaths caused by COVID-19 and NCDs. Current and projected repercussions from COVID-19 and an uncontrolled NCD burden on vulnerable host communities, specifically refugee populations, requires an urgent, enhanced, enlarged, integrated health system response, and development of a robust NCDs programme in Jordan. \r\n\r\nThe Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) will prioritize the Health sector in this project proposal, based on its previous experience with Healthy Community Clinic (HCC) program since 2011 providing NCDs prevention and care and recent COVID-19 national campaign, as well as local consultations with the Ministry of Health (MOH), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Health Organization (WHO), its partners, international and national non-governmental organizations (INGOs/NGOs), The project will support saving lives, alleviate suffering, and increase access to humanitarian assistance for vulnerable People with Special Needs, such as People Living With NCDs (PLWNCDs), NCD patients, elderly people at risk, Syrian refugees, refugees of other nationalities, and vulnerable Jordanians, inclusive of people with disabilities, prioritizing female-head households, incorporating gender mainstreaming, when possible. RHAS will provide safe and effective clinical care for NCD patients through care for individuals who are at the highest risk for poor outcomes, ensure that older patients, patients with comorbid conditions, and other vulnerable people are prioritized. The project’s interventions will be multi-sectoral, with the aim to prevent and control COVID-19 and NCDs to foster a healthy societal environment, in which people are encouraged to make and maintain healthy living choices promote health literacy so that people can protect and improve their health build the capacity of health care providers provide health services focused on early detection of COVID-19, cost-effective management of NCDs and their risk factors respond to the specific needs of vulnerable groups with NCDs affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and keeping communities as protected as possible from the impact of COVID-19 and NCDs. To maximize the project's impact, the project activities will address critical needs in the Health sector and address the needs of healthcare providers, prioritizing areas with the highest needs, complementing sector projects and interventions in targeted geographical areas (primarily north and central governorates of Jordan), to support coherence and added value. The implementation of the project would promote a focus on COVID-19 and NCDs by the public health system in Jordan, specifically at primary care and community levels, whereby COVID-19 and NCDs are prevented and managed for refugee populations and Jordanians through an integrated national response. This would be embedded within the idealized transition towards ‘universal health coverage’ for all, galvanized by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

          "On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC). The Emergency Committee has also provided recommendations to WHO, to all countries, and to the global community, on measures to control the outbreak. On the 11 March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, affecting 123 countries and territories.  On 5 March, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) reported its first 7 confirmed COVID-19 cases to WHO - a cluster of hotel workers in Bethlehem who were in contact with a Greek tourist group which tested positive for COVID-19 upon their return to Greece. Since then, MoH reported 158 more confirmed cases bringing the total number to 165 (as of 03-Apr-2020, 10:00am). Cases have now been reported all across the oPt, including in Gaza (12 cases as of 03-Apr-2020, 10:00am). The MoH has also reported the localized community transmission of the virus as family members of the first detected had also been tested positive for COVID-19.\r\n\r\nSince the first cases were reported globally, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and partners have been gradually expanding the support to the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health (MoH) to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. These efforts intensified since the first reported cases in oPt. The overall objective of this project is to support the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health (PA MoH) to contain the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19. The project aims to accelerate the strengthening and scaling-up of the MoH capacity to early detect the COVID-19 and adequately trace contacts of confirmed cases. WHO will support the MoH in: (1) procuring and delivering the essential supplies for scaling-up of laboratory testing for COVID-19 and expanding laboratory support. WHO estimates that up to 5,000 women and men in oPr will have access to adequate COVID-19 screening through laboratory testing. This allocation would contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the inter-agency COVID-19 response plan launched on 27 March. It is also in line with the Palestinian National COVID-19 Response Plan launched by the PM’s office on 26 March 2020."

ACHIEVEMENTS\rPALM Corps in partnership with Horizont3000, Welthungerhilfe, SNV, Eleanor Crook Foundation, ZOA, Volkshilfe secured funds to provide services to the refugees and host communities in West Nile. A total of 1,619 pregnant and Lactating Women and 925 CU2 in Moyo district were directly supported under nutrition project funded by Eleanor Crook Foundation; 2500 pupils in Rhino camp refugee settlement were reached with school feeding and 480 parents of the children supported to improve their knowledge on good farming practices; 180 (75 female) youth are skilled through various trades including saloon, carpentry, building, motorcycle repair, bakery and vegetable growing with support of Welhungerhilfe and Horizont3000; 250acres of teak woodlots established in Rhinocamp and Imvepi refugee settlements in Arua district with funds from BMZ (Germany); access to education is being improved for over 5000 school girls(refugeesand host) in Rhinocamp and finally 50 agribusinesses  including SMEs and farmer groups were linked to market and finance.\r3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE\rMission: To improve the quality of life of the poorest and most vulnerable communities through innovative, sustainable, evidence-based and people-centred programmes that transform their livelihood practices, attitudes and values.\r\rInstitutional objectives: PALM desires to see a world wherethe poorest and most vulnerable communities live a dignified, healthy, peaceful and productive life\r\rField(s) of activity: PALM Corps is permitted/Licenced by NGO Bureau to operate in West Nile, and Northern Uganda. Butcurrently the operations are limited to West Nile.  The sectors are Agriculture and Livelihoods, Primary Education, Nutrition, WASHand Environment.\r4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING\rThe influx of refugees in West Nile has attracted a couple of humanitarian and development organizations who areproviding social services to the refugees and the host community to complement on government efforts. With the localization policy of the government of Uganda, this presents opportunities for local organizations to partner with the international organizations to participate in responding to the crisis and development challenges in the region. The demand for social services in huge especially in the refugee settlements where access to and quality of education, health services and food is a problem. WFP provides food or cash for refugees to buy food. The prices of food items increased as result of the influx and unfortunately the local population is not responding adequately to produce food to meet the demand. The region is still net importer of food itemsespecially vegetables, beans and maize from other regions of Uganda and DRC.  PALM has rich experience of value chain development and facilitation of multi-stakeholder processes which makes the organization attractive to several development actors.\r5.

ACHIEVEMENTS\rPALM Corps in partnership with Horizont3000, Welthungerhilfe, SNV, Eleanor Crook Foundation, ZOA, Volkshilfe secured funds to provide services to the refugees and host communities in West Nile. A total of 1,619 pregnant and Lactating Women and 925 CU2 in Moyo district were directly supported under nutrition project funded by Eleanor Crook Foundation; 2500 pupils in Rhino camp refugee settlement were reached with school feeding and 480 parents of the children supported to improve their knowledge on good farming practices; 180 (75 female) youth are skilled through various trades including saloon, carpentry, building, motorcycle repair, bakery and vegetable growing with support of Welhungerhilfe and Horizont3000; 250acres of teak woodlots established in Rhinocamp and Imvepi refugee settlements in Arua district with funds from BMZ (Germany); access to education is being improved for over 5000 school girls(refugeesand host) in Rhinocamp and finally 50 agribusinesses  including SMEs and farmer groups were linked to market and finance.\r3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE\rMission: To improve the quality of life of the poorest and most vulnerable communities through innovative, sustainable, evidence-based and people-centred programmes that transform their livelihood practices, attitudes and values.\r\rInstitutional objectives: PALM desires to see a world wherethe poorest and most vulnerable communities live a dignified, healthy, peaceful and productive life\r\rField(s) of activity: PALM Corps is permitted/Licenced by NGO Bureau to operate in West Nile, and Northern Uganda. Butcurrently the operations are limited to West Nile.  The sectors are Agriculture and Livelihoods, Primary Education, Nutrition, WASHand Environment.\r4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING\rThe influx of refugees in West Nile has attracted a couple of humanitarian and development organizations who areproviding social services to the refugees and the host community to complement on government efforts. With the localization policy of the government of Uganda, this presents opportunities for local organizations to partner with the international organizations to participate in responding to the crisis and development challenges in the region. The demand for social services in huge especially in the refugee settlements where access to and quality of education, health services and food is a problem. WFP provides food or cash for refugees to buy food. The prices of food items increased as result of the influx and unfortunately the local population is not responding adequately to produce food to meet the demand. The region is still net importer of food itemsespecially vegetables, beans and maize from other regions of Uganda and DRC.  PALM has rich experience of value chain development and facilitation of multi-stakeholder processes which makes the organization attractive to several development actors.\r5.

Butcurrently the operations are limited to West Nile.  The sectors are Agriculture and Livelihoods, Primary Education, Nutrition, WASHand Environment.\r4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING\rThe influx of refugees in West Nile has attracted a couple of humanitarian and development organizations who areproviding social services to the refugees and the host community to complement on government efforts. With the localization policy of the government of Uganda, this presents opportunities for local organizations to partner with the international organizations to participate in responding to the crisis and development challenges in the region. The demand for social services in huge especially in the refugee settlements where access to and quality of education, health services and food is a problem. WFP provides food or cash for refugees to buy food. The prices of food items increased as result of the influx and unfortunately the local population is not responding adequately to produce food to meet the demand. The region is still net importer of food itemsespecially vegetables, beans and maize from other regions of Uganda and DRC.  PALM has rich experience of value chain development and facilitation of multi-stakeholder processes which makes the organization attractive to several development actors.\r5.

          "The proposed intervention concerns the Niger component of the COVID-19 Crisis Response Programme in the G5 Sahel Countries (PARC COVID-19 – G5 SAHEL). This is a loan and award a grant to the G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad) of UA 118.9 million and UA 89.6 million respectively from the COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility. It will be implemented over 12 months from July 2020. The Programme was appraised in April 2020 following requests to the Bank by the countries. Niger recorded its first case of COVID-19 on 19 March 2020. As of 5 June 2020, the country had 1461 cases, the number of which has been rising steadily in the last few days. To curb the spread of the COVID19 pandemic, the country has taken several preventive and protective measures, including: (i) a nationwide ban on gatherings; (ii) the closure of all land borders, except for the transportation of goods; (iii) the suspension of public land transport; and (iv) the imposition of a curfew in Niamey. These measures have led to a drastic contraction of supply and demand, resulting in a sudden downturn in Niger’s economy. This Programme complements the other budget support operations, particularly the Multinational Coronavirus Pandemic Control Support Project for G5 member countries approved on 9 June 2020, aimed at providing the region with adequate operational capacities to combat the pandemic. More specifically, the programme will contribute to the financing of response plans through the budget support it will provide. It will also support measures aimed at improving the financial management of the response plans and mitigating the health, social and economic-related impacts.",

Elle sera mise en œuvre sur une période de 12 mois à partir de juillet 2020. Le programme a été évalué en avril 2020, à la suite des demandes adressées par les pays à la Banque. Le Niger a enregistré son premier cas de personne infectée par la COVID-19 le 19 mars 2020. Au 5 juin 2020, le pays enregistrait 1461 cas, en progression soutenue au cours des derniers jours. Pour contenir la propagation de la pandémie de la COVID-19, le pays a pris plusieurs mesures de prévention et de protection comme : (i) l’interdiction sur toute l’étendue du territoire national des rassemblements ; (ii) la fermeture de toutes les frontières terrestres, excepté pour le transport des marchandises ; (iii) la suspension des transports terrestres en commun ; et (iv) l’instauration à Niamey d’un couvre-feu. Ces mesures ont engendré une forte contraction de l’offre et de la demande économiques, conduisant ainsi à un brusque ralentissement général de l’économie nigérienne. Le Programme vient en complément des autres appuis de la Banque, notamment le Projet multinational d’appui en faveur des pays membres du G5 sahel pour la lutte contre la pandémie a coronavirus approuvé le 9 juin 2020, qui vise à doter la région de capacités opérationnelles pour faire face à la pandémie. De manière spécifique, le Programme contribuera au financement des plans de riposte grâce aux aides budgétaires qu’il apporte. Il soutiendra également des mesures visant une meilleure gestion financière des plans de riposte, et une atténuation des impacts de la pandémie au plan sanitaire, social et économique.",
          "The overall objective of this programme is to contribute to mitigating the health, social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Niger. Its specific objectives are to: (i) build the capacity of the health system to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable people; and (iii) mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "Le programme a pour objectif global de contribuer à l’atténuation de l’incidence de la pandémie de la COVID-19 sur le plan sanitaire, social et économique au Niger. Il vise spécifiquement : (i) le renforcement des capacités sanitaires de lutte contre la pandémie de la COVID-19 ; (ii) l’atténuation de l’incidence sur les personnes vulnérables de la pandémie de la COVID-19 ; et (iii) l’atténuation de l’incidence économique de la pandémie de la COVID-19.",
          "The entire population of Niger will benefit from this programme which will help to mitigate the health and socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population, especially the most vulnerable segments, including women. It will also contribute to reducing the economic shock on local enterprises (including SMEs run by women) affected by the sharp economic downturn resulting from the pandemic. The programme will also make it possible to build the capacity of Niger’s public administration in health response, protection of the most vulnerable segments of the population and support to economic activities. All these elements will contribute to strengthening the resilience of Niger’s economy and reducing the country’s fragility factors.",
          "Toute la population nigérienne bénéficiera du présent programme. Il permettra d’atténuer les impacts sanitaires et socio-économiques de la pandémie de la COVID-19 sur la population, et notamment les plus vulnérables, y compris les femmes. Il contribuera également à réduire le choc économique sur les entreprises nationales (y compris les PME dirigées par des femmes) victimes du fort ralentissement de l’économie résultant de la pandémie en cours. Par ailleurs, grâce à ce programme, les capacités de l’administration publique nigérienne seront renforcées en matière de riposte sanitaire, de protection des couches les plus vulnérables de la population et de soutien à l’activité économique. Tous ces éléments contribueront à renforcer la résilience de l’économie nigérienne et à réduire les facteurs de fragilité du pays."

          "The COVID-19 Crisis Response Support Program (CRSP) to Uganda is designed as budget support within the framework of the Bank Group’s COVID-19 Crisis Response Facility. Uganda confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on 21 March 2020. This number had increased to 1,075 confirmed cases on July 22. The country’s overburdened health system does not have adequate resources to face this health emergency. Uganda is currently facing an additional challenge of a deadly invasion of desert locusts, which is posing a threat to food security and exacerbating the country’s vulnerability during this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the Ugandan economy hard, both directly and indirectly, through global, regional and domestic transmission channels, with the hospitality, tourism, trading and manufacturing industries particularly badly affected. The Government has responded to the crisis with a broad financial package aimed at tackling the COVID-19 health emergency and supporting economic activity. It allocated resources to the health sector, expand social safety net programs, and provide targeted support to the impacted economic sectors. The program, which results from a request of the Government dated April 9th, 2020, was appraised on 15-30 April 2020, and will be applied for a period of one year (2020/2021). Bank support, estimated at UA 23 million, will provide financing to the budget for targeted spending, aimed at containing and mitigating the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "Le Programme d’appui en réponse à la crise du COVID-19 (PARC) en Ouganda se présente sous forme d’appui budgétaire en réponse à la crise (ARBC) en conformité avec la Facilité de réponse rapide à la COVID-19 (CRF) du Groupe de la Banque. L’Ouganda a confirmé son premier cas de Covid-19 le 21 mars 2020. Au 22 juillet 2020, le nombre de personnes atteintes du coronavirus était de 1 075 cas confirmés. Le système de santé surchargé du pays ne dispose pas de ressources suffisantes pour faire face à cette urgence sanitaire. L’Ouganda est, en outre, actuellement confronté à un défi supplémentaire, celui d’une invasion de criquets pèlerins, qui constitue une menace pour la sécurité alimentaire et exacerbe la vulnérabilité du pays durant cette pandémie. La pandémie de Covid-19 a durement frappé l’économie ougandaise, de façon directe et indirecte, à travers la baisse des flux de transmission mondiaux, régionaux et nationaux. Elle a notamment affecté particulièrement les secteurs de l’hôtellerie, du tourisme, du commerce et de la fabrication. Le gouvernement a réagi à la crise par un vaste programme financier visant à s’attaquer à l’urgence sanitaire imposée par le Covid-19 et à soutenir l’activité économique. Il a affecté des ressources au secteur de la santé, a élargi les programmes de protection sociale et a apporté un soutien ciblé aux secteurs économiques touchés. Faisant suite à la demande formulée par le gouvernement en date du 9 avril 2020, le programme a été évalué du 15 au 30 avril 2020 et se déroulera sur une période d’un an (2020/2021). Le soutien de la Banque, estimé à 23 millions d’UC, sera mis en œuvre par un financement budgétaire de dépenses ciblées, visant à contenir et à atténuer l’impact sanitaire et économique de la pandémie du Covid-19.",
          "The goal of the proposed operation is to support Uganda’s National COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan to strengthen the COVID-19 outbreak response mechanisms and mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. The proposed operation seeks to achieve three short-term and medium-term outcomes: (i) enhanced capacity to test and treat COVID-19 patients to reduce risk of infection and morbidity; (ii) ease impact of the lockdown, and other COVID-19 related measures, on the poorest; and (iii) mitigate risk to medium-term macroeconomic stabilization and economic resilience.",
          "Le programme a pour objectif de soutenir le Plan national de préparation et de riposte à la COVID-19 pour renforcer les mécanismes d’action et atténuer les effets économiques et sociaux de la pandémie. L’opération cible trois effets à court et moyen terme : i) capacité accrue de test et de traitement des patients atteints de COVID-19 afin de réduire le risque d’infection et de morbidité ; ii) effets amoindris du confinement et d’autres mesures de lutte contre la pandémie sur les plus pauvres ; et iii) risque atténué pour la stabilisation macroéconomique et la résilience économique à moyen terme.",
          "The program will benefit the poor and vulnerable through rapid diagnosis, isolation and management of infected persons, strengthened livelihoods and expanded social protection coverage which includes vulnerable households and the urban poor. The program will also benefit households, private sector, financial sector actors through a faster and more inclusive economic recovery on the back of a more resilient businesses and workforce.",
          "Le programme profitera aux pauvres et aux personnes vulnérables grâce au diagnostic rapide, à l’isolement et à la prise en charge des personnes infectées, au renforcement des moyens de subsistance et à l’élargissement de la couverture de protection sociale aux ménages vulnérables et aux pauvres des zones urbaines. Il sera également bénéfique pour les ménages, le secteur privé et les acteurs du secteur financier grâce à une reprise économique plus rapide et plus inclusive, soutenue par des entreprises et une main-d’œuvre plus résiliente."

          "New/additional funds to address COVID-19\rPurpose\nThe purpose of the contribution is to support the implementation of the continental Covid-19 strategy \"Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak\". The strategy was adopted by the African Union (all Africa's 55 health ministers/health ministries) on February 22, 2020 during a crisis meeting. The strategy has two overarching goals: to prevent severe disease and death from Covid-19 infection in member states and to minimize the social and economic consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nAn Addendum to the strategy has also been developed, the AU COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan Addendum to the African Union COVID-19 Continental Strategy, which includes specific reference to ensure access to basic health care, including maternal and child health care during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHenceforth, it should be noted that the reference to strategy includes both the Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak” and its Addendum. The strategy includes the following pillars: Coordination and Collaboration; Surveillance; Laboratory; Countermeasures; Healthcare Preparedness; Risk Communication and Social Engagement; Supply Chain Management; Special Populations, Settings, and Policies; and Science, Standards and Regulations.\n\nAfrica Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a specialized agency of the African Union. Africa CDC has been tasked by the African Union to implement the strategy.\n\nSida intends to support the Africa CDC with 20 million SEK to implement the pillars focused on Coordination and Collaboration and Risk Communication and Social Engagement.\n\nThis has been determined in consultation with the EU and other member states that constitute Team Europe, which includes Sweden. The arrangement means that the EU and the member states (Spain, Sweden, Germany and Austria) are coordinated through a joint budget and work plan and joint reporting (both narrative and financial, including audit). Team Europe's total support amounts to EUR 25.85 million (includes SEK 20 million from Sida). Attached document “Joint planning and reporting arrangements for Team Europe support to ACDC” sets out all relevant details. However, it should be noted that Sweden will enter into a bilateral/separate agreement with Africa CDC.\n\nSida will contribute to Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak and its Addendum through two other contributions: WHO-AFRO (SEK 30 million) and Together4SRHR (SEK 30 million through an amendment to the agreement). Sida views the contributions as three parts of a coherent support in line with the above strategy, and comprises a total of SEK 80 million.\n\nThe strategy is implemented through the Africa Task Force for Coronavirus (AFTCOR), where Africa CDC, UN and AU member countries lead working groups, and through Africa CDC's Incident Management System (IMS). A number of partners, both UN and non-state actors, also contribute to the implementation of the strategy.\n\nThese implementing partners are financed either directly by aid donors who finance supplementary efforts, or via Africa CDC, which then transfers funds to implementing partners.\n\nContext\nThe reason that the contribution (without an explicit focus on SRHR) is funded by the regional SRHR strategy is because of the expected consequences of COVID-19. These are anticipated to be dramatic and all-encompassing regarding the development spectrum – encompassing e.g., social and economic aspects. \n\nAfrica CDC reports that with regards to its member states that there on 25 June 2020 was: 337,315 cases; and 8,863 deaths. Clearly, it is important to note that these are only reported/confirmed cases and that numbers rapidly increase daily. \n\nDespite the various measures in place, the virus is likely to spread further and likely to continue to have significant impacts on e.g., the economy and livelihoods of the populations of the African continent. The social, health and development impacts of the pandemic on the continent are currently devastating and could signify a reversal of the development gains of the previous decades - there are already evidence that point to this direction.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that Sub-Saharan African economies could lose between USD 37 to USD 79 billion in 2020 due to consequences of COVID-19. Economic growth could contract from 2.4% in 2019 to -5.1% in 2020, bringing about the first recession in 25 years. \n\nSida notes that a challenge attached to the contribution could be longer term institutional strengthening and sustainability given that the focus and purpose is intertwined with COVID-19 and its trajectory. The agreement will cover a one year implementation period and entail a one-off disbursement. Nonetheless, there are reasons to assume that there will rippling effects and that the contribution will help also to strengthen Africa’s national public health institutions’ capacities to reduce the overall disease burden on the continent – beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The issue of sustainability will be an ongoing dialogue issue between Sweden, Africa CDC, the EU and other relevant stakeholders. \n\nSida recognizes that the work of Africa CDC is crucial as health is a development issue that affects the economic, social and security concerns of countries and regions. This is especially apparent when infections or epidemics occur as became apparent during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014/2015 and again during the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSida also takes note of the precarious situation on the African continent, which currently faces the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and injury and trauma. This is combined with fragile health systems and inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, population mobility that will make key preventing measures such as physical distancing very difficult to uphold, and contribute to increase susceptibility for unrest.\n\nChallenges resulting from several infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, TB and malaria), maternal mortality as well as outbreaks such as yellow fever, cholera and natural disasters (as a result of climate change and conflict), still affect the continent adversely and continue to pose serious threats alongside the current COVID-19 pandemic, which will likely cause widespread illness and death in Africa (according to Africa CDC). One factor that could mitigate deaths in Africa is demography; more than 50 percent of the population is under 20 years old, a group that has been relatively spared from illness and death from COVID-19 across the world.\n\nOverall with regards to health security, the Ebola crisis in 2014-2015 highlighted the unpreparedness of health systems in Africa. It was then made clear that health systems in Africa are unable to adequately cope with major health crises. Urgent and collective action is now needed to protect the African region from the health security threat that the COVID-19 pandemic poses.\n\nIt is clear that capacity gaps are due to insufficient resources (financial, human, and logistics) and fragmented services. Furthermore, limited community engagement, weak health systems, inadequate inter-country collaborations, and limited effective partnerships.\n\nAcross the world, African countries are least prepared for epidemics or pandemics. All African countries lack foundational health systems capacities for vital epidemic and pandemic response and national health security is fundamentally weak across the African continent. There are also severe weaknesses in countries’ abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to health emergencies; vulnerabilities to political, socioeconomic, and environmental risks that can confound outbreak preparedness and response; and, a lack of adherence to international norms.\n\nAfrica CDC acts now to support African countries to address these gaps through coordination and to strengthen preparedness and response through partnerships.",
          "Nya medel/medeltillägg för att bekämpa covid-19\rSyfte\nInsatsens syfte är att stödja implementeringen av den kontinentala covid-19 strategin ”Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak”. Strategin antogs av den Afrikanska Unionen (alla Afrikas 55 hälsoministrar/hälsoministerier) 22 februari 2020 under ett krismöte. Strategin har två övergripande mål: att förebygga svår sjukdom och död av Covid-19 infektion i medlemsländer och att minimera sociala och ekonomiska konsekvenser av covid-19 utbrottet.\n\nEtt tillägg finns även till strategin, AU COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan Addendum to the African Union COVID-19 Continental Strategy, som inkluderar specifik referens till att säkerställa tillgång till grundläggande hälsosjukvård, inklusive mödrabarnhälsovård under covid-19 pandemin.\n\nMed strategin menas hädanefter både Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak och dess Addendum. \n\nStrategin omfattar följande pelare: Coordination and Collaboration; Surveillance; Laboratory; Countermeasures; Healthcare Preparedness; Risk Communication and Social Engagement; Supply Chain Management; Special Populations, Settings, and Policies; och Science, Standards and Regulations. \n\nAfrica Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) är en institution som tillhör den Afrikanska Unionen. Africa CDC har av den Afrikanska Unionen fått uppdraget att implementera strategin. \n\nSida avser att stödja Africa CDC med 20 miljoner SEK för implementerandet av pelare fokuserade på Coordination and Collaboration och Risk Communication and Social Engagement. \n\nDetta har bestämts i samråd med EU och andra medlemsstater som utgör Team Europe där Sverige ingår. Upplägget innebär at EU och medlemsstaterna (Spanien, Sverige, Tyskland och Österrike) är samordnade under en gemensam budget och arbetsplan och gemensam rapportering (både narrativ och finansiell, inklusive revision). Team Europes totala stöd utgör EUR 25,85 miljoner (inkluderar 20 miljoner SEK från Sida). Bilagt dokument “Joint planning and reporting arrangements for Team Europe support to ACDC” redogör för alla relevanta detaljer. Det bör dock noteras att Sverige kommer att ingå ett bilateralt/separat avtal med Kommissionen för den Afrikanska Unionen. \n\nSida kommer att bidra till Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak och dess Addendum genom två andra insatser WHO-AFRO (30 miljoner SEK) och Together4SRHR (30 miljoner SEK genom en avtalsändring). Sida ser på insatserna som tre delar av ett sammanhållet stöd i linje med ovan nämnda strategi, och omfattar totalt 80 miljoner SEK. \n\nDen kontinentala COVID-19 strategin implementeras genom Africa Task Force for Coronavirus (AFTCOR), där Africa CDC, FN och AU:s medlemsländer leder arbetsgrupper, och genom Africa CDC’s Incident Management System (IMS). Ett antal partners, både FN och ickestatliga aktörer, bidrar också till att implementera strategin.\n\nDessa implementerande partners finansieras antingen direkt av biståndsgivare som finansierar kompletterande insatser, eller via Africa CDC som sedan vidareförmedlar medel till implementerande partners. \n\nKontext\nAnledningen till att insatsen (utan ett uttryckligt fokus på SRHR) finansieras av den regionala SRHR-strategin är på grund av de förväntade konsekvenserna av COVID-19. Dessa förväntas vara dramatiska och allomfattande vad gäller utvecklingsspektrumet - som t.ex. omfattar sociala och ekonomiska aspekter, och COIVD-19 riskerar att tränga undan annan grundläggande hälso- och sjukvård, inklusive tjänster för sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa.\n\nAfrica CDC rapporterar att det bland sina medlemsländer, den 25 juni 2020 ,fanns: 337 315 bekräftade fall av Covid-19; och 8 863 bekräftade dödsfall till följd av Covid-19. Det bör noteras att dessa endast avser rapporterade/bekräftad fall och att antalet snabbt ökar dagligen.\n\nTrots att olika åtgärder har vidtagits kommer viruset enligt olika beräkningar att spridas ytterligare och fortsätta att ha betydande effekter på t.ex. ekonomin och livsmedelsförsörjningen på den afrikanska kontinenten. De sociala, hälso- och utvecklingseffekterna av pandemin på kontinenten är för närvarande förödande och kan innebära att utvecklingsvinningar under de senaste decennierna urholkas. Det finns redan bevis som pekar på denna riktning.\n\nVärldsbanken uppskattar att de afrikanska ekonomierna söder om Sahara kan förlora mellan 37 och 79 miljarder USD under år 2020 till följd av Covid-19 konsekvenser. Den ekonomiska tillväxten kan minska från 2,4% 2019 till -5,1% 2020, vilket skulle leda till den första lågkonjunkturen på 25 år.\n\nSida konstaterar att en utmaning kopplad till insatsen kan vara långsiktigt institutionellt stärkande och hållbarhet med tanke på att fokus och syfte är sammanflätade med Covid-19 och dess utveckling.\n\nAvtalet täcker en implementeringsperiod på ett år och innebär en engångsutbetalning. Det finns emellertid skäl att anta att insatsen kommer att ha bredare effekter och att insatsen också kommer att bidra till att stärka Afrikas nationella folkhälsoinstitutioners kapacitet för att minska den totala sjukdomsbördan på kontinenten bortom Covid-19-pandemin. Hållbarhet kommer att vara en pågående dialogfråga mellan Sverige, Africa CDC, EU och andra relevanta aktörer.\n\nSida anser att Africa CDC:s arbete är mycket viktigt eftersom hälsa är en utvecklingsfråga som påverkar de ekonomiska, sociala och säkerhetsmässiga aspekterna i länder och regioner. Detta är särskilt uppenbart när det gäller infektioner eller epidemier. Detta visade sig under Ebola-utbrottet i Västafrika 2014/2015 och återigen under den nuvarande COVID-19-pandemi.\n\nSida noterar också den osäkra situationen på den afrikanska kontinenten, som för närvarande står inför bördan av smittsamma och icke-smittsamma sjukdomar, skador och trauma. Detta kombineras med bräckliga hälsosystem och otillräcklig infrastruktur för vatten, sanitet och hygien och stor befolkningsrörlighet. Detta kommer att göra viktiga förebyggande åtgärder som fysisk distansering mycket svåra att upprätthålla och öka risken för oroligheter.\n\nUtmaningar till följd av flera infektionssjukdomar (t.ex. HIV, TB och malaria), mödradödlighet samt utbrott som gulafeber, kolera och naturkatastrofer (som ett resultat av klimatförändringar och konflikter), påverkar fortfarande kontinenten negativt och fortsätter att utgöra allvarliga hot tillsammans med den nuvarande Covid-19 pandemin, som sannolikt kommer att orsaka utbredd sjukdom och död i Afrika (enligt Africa CDC). En faktor som kan mildra dödsfall i Afrika är demografi; mer än 50 procent av befolkningen är under 20 år gammal, en grupp som över hela världen har relativt förskonats från sjukdom och död till följd av Covid-19. \n\nÖvergripande när det gäller hälsosäkerhet visade Ebolakrisen 2014–2015 att hälsosystem i Afrika inte kan hantera stora hälsokriser på ett tillfredsställande sätt. Brådskande och kollektiva åtgärder behövs nu för att skydda den afrikanska regionen från det hälsohot som Covid-19-pandemin utgör.\n\nDet är uppenbart att kapacitetsbrister beror på otillräckliga resurser (ekonomiska, mänskliga och logistiska) och fragmenterade tjänster. Dessutom finns andra stora utmaningar, t.ex. begränsat samhällsengagemang, svaga hälsosystem, otillräckliga samarbeten mellan länder och begränsade effektiva partnerskap.\n\nÖver hela världen är afrikanska länder minst förberedda på att hantera epidemier eller pandemier. I alla afrikanska länder saknas grundläggande kapacitet bland hälsosystem för att effektivt bekämpa epidemier och pandemier. Det finns även allvarliga brister i ländernas förmåga att förebygga, upptäcka och bemöta hälsohot; hög utsatthet för politiska, socioekonomiska och miljömässiga risker som kan försvåra beredskap och hanterandet av utbrott; och bristande efterlevnad av internationella normer.\n\nAfrica CDC agerar nu för att stödja afrikanska länder att hantera dessa brister genom att samordna, och stärka beredskap och respons genom partnerskap.",
          "The first and foremost purpose of the intended contribution is to enable Africa CDC to promptly and systematically implement “The Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak”, endorsed by the AU. The articulated goals of the strategy are to: prevent severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection in African Union (AU) member states; and, to minimize social disruption and economic consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks.\nThe strategy has two objectives: coordinate efforts of AU member states, AU agencies, WHO, and other partners and stakeholder to ensure synergy and minimize duplication; and, promote evidence-based public health practice for surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and control of COVID-19.\nConsequently, beyond the pressing need to ensure 1) effective coordination and collaboration, the strategy (and the addendum - i.e., implementation plan) stipulates that efforts will be dedicated to:\n2) Surveillance: Collect, analyze, and disseminate accurate, timely data about the epidemiology of COVID-19.\n3) Laboratory: Ensure quality-assured testing for COVID-19 diagnosis, genotyping, and special studies.\n4) Countermeasures: Support implementation of evidence-based interventions at individual and population-level to reduce COVID-19 transmission.\n5) Healthcare preparedness: Strengthen capacity of healthcare facilities to manage surge in patient visits and to effectively identify, isolate, and manage people with COVID-19 infection.\n6) Risk communication and social engagement: Provide guidance that is clear, comprehensible, evidence based, culturally appropriate, and adapted to special populations and circumstances.\n7) Supply chain management: Establish and maintain supply chains for shared resources, including personal protective equipment, laboratory supplies and equipment, and, if available and necessary, medical countermeasures.\n8) Special populations, settings, and policies: Assess and manage issues related to special populations (e.g., refugees, internally displaced persons), analyze and guide on ethical and legal issues (e.g., quarantine, healthcare triage, travel, trade), and develop plans for continuity of essential public health operations (e.g., maternal child health programs, immunizations).\n9) Science, standards and regulations: Ensure that timelyand coordinated scientific and policy information is made available to decision makers within AU member states.\nThe Sida funds will be dedicated to pillar 1) effective coordination and collaboration and pillar 6) risk communication and social engagement.\nIn terms of specific results, the Swedish contribution will primarily contribute to: \n-A more effectively functioning Africa CDC, including improved functions in regional coordination, epi analysis, and partnership development.\n-Reductions in disease spread in countries where community health workers were deployed due to more effective public health behaviors (e.g., physical distancing, mask wearing, hand washing etc.). \nThis has been agreed with the EU and other member states, who will fund other pillars and results - all in a harmonized approach. Through the Team Europe, also the following results will be achieved (to be funded by other members):\n- Improvements in healthcare outcomes (e.g., lower spread of cases and less severe cases) in IDP and refugee camp settings. \n- Improved member state capacity in surveillance and detection through technical experts, trainings, and community health workers. \n- Increase in testing rates in countries where lab supplies are distributed. \n- Improvements in testing, tracing and treatment outcomes in countries where community health workers and rapid responders are deployed. \nThe joint Team Europe work plan and budget outlines what the EU as an entity and each EU member state will fund, and should thus be consulted for details.\nIt should be noted that the Swedish contribution has also been harmonized with the support to WHO-AFRO and the Together4SRHR platform and is in line with the relevant Swedish strategy for the regional SRHR team (see the appraisal plan regarding details pertaining to the 2 relevant Swedish government strategies)."

          "On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for countries to prepare and respond to it in time. Afterwards, on 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic as it spreads to many countries. Globally, as of 10:00am CEST, 01 May 2020, a total of 3,175, 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 224, 172 deaths (CFR% 7.06%) have been reported to WHO from 215 countries, areas or territories. In the Sudan, according to the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), 91 new confirmed cases and associated 5 deaths of COVID-19 were reported on 01 May 2020 increasing the total number of confirmed cases to 533 with 36 associated deaths (CFR: 6.7 %) and 42 recovered cases. Majority of the confirmed cases (474 89%) are from Khartoum State  followed by Gezira (24 cases), Sinnar (8 case), North Kordofan (8 cases), River Nile (5 case), Gedaref (5 cases) and West Kordofan (2 cases). The government of Sudan has been implementing various “lock downs” to slow COVID-19 transmission by limiting contact between people. \r\n\r\nThe WHO has defined four transmission scenarios for COVID-19 and advised each country to assess its risk and rapidly implement the necessary measures at the appropriate scale at national and sub-national level as there is no one-size-fits-all. Accordingly, WHO classified the current transmission scenario in Sudan as “sporadic” as cases are either imported or locally detected. The WHO recommended that countries must do everything they can to stop cases from becoming clusters and clusters from becoming explosive outbreaks. As hitherto experiences attested, majority (80%) of COVID-19 patients developed into mild and moderate disease. Only 15% develops sever diseases while only 5% develops critical diseases requiring in patient care or Intensive Care Units (ICU) at designated isolation centres. Confirmed COVID-19 cases should be isolated in dedicated facilities to prevent transmission and optimize clinical care.  Rapid expansion of clinical care capacity to manage COVID-19 cases requires substantial reconfiguring of existing health facilities and repurposing existing health facilities to provide essential life-saving services. In Sudan, only 14 out of 46 (30%) designated COVID-19 isolation facilities in 14 States are functioning with a total capacity of 641 normal beds, 69 ICU beds and 53 ventilators as at 30 April 2020. Recent assessments by WHO revealed that there are huge gaps in the designated isolation centres prepared for management of COVID-19 cases in Sudan. Among other things, isolation centres and treatment facilities lack appropriate equipment, medicines, medical supplies and WASH facilities in most instances. The need for operational support to functional isolation centres was reported in many occasions. \r\n\r\nAlthough there were no suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases reported from the two-areas, it is a matter of time, since all the three countries neighboring them (South Sudan, Ethiopia and Sudan) already reported confirmed  COVID-19 cases and their transmission scenarios are fast progressing. Preventing importation of cases in underserved and marginalized communities such as the newly accessed two areas in South Kordofan and Blue Nile state is both critical and human-right issue. Such areas could serve as amplifiers of the pandemic becoming clusters of cases without timely intervention. Therefore, the two-areas are at greater risk of importation and local spread of COVID-19 without timely interventions. \r\n\r\nThis project is going to complement ongoing government, UN agencies and NGOs response effort under the auspices of the Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) to COVID-19. As WHO, this proposal will focus on addressing the three pillars of interventions (i.e. risk communication, IPC and case management) identified as critical gaps by the allocation paper in 11 prioritized States of Suda"

          "The proposed action’s objective is to strengthen awareness and implementation of optimal COVID19-specific and general hygiene practices in local communities and health facilities at-risk or affected by COVID19 in order to contain on-going COVID19 outbreak in the targeted areas of Ghor Province.\r\n\r\nIn the already fragile country of Afghanistan with a “current coverage of WASH services including water supply infrastructure, sanitation facilities and hygiene promotion supplies already unable to adequately support basic WASH needs from conflict and natural disasters” according to the COVID19 Multi-sector Humanitarian Country Plan, the additional burden of a country-wide disease outbreak could have disastrous consequences. The first confirmed case in Afghanistan has been reported by MoPH on February 24th, in Herat province. Since then, additional provinces have been infected, with now 20 out of 34 provinces experiencing confirmed cases with a total of 484 confirmed cases according to OCHA’s last Daily Brief (9th of April). Ghor province is already particularly affected by cycles of heavy armed conflict and natural disaster like drought, heavy rain cause to flash flood and have very high needs in terms of WASH. The emergence of the COVID19 outbreak could be disastrous considering also the fragile health system in this Province.\r\n\r\nIn order to respond to the high needs identified, Action Against Hunger (AAH) will launch a WASH emergency response to the COVID19 outbreak to increase the implementation of improved hygiene practices, notably hand-washing, and, so, prevent further spread of COVID19 outbreak, both at community level and health facilities level and with a specific focus on malnourished boys and girls. This emergency response will target 58,089 persons (15,371 men, 15,998 women, 13,091 boys and 13,629 girls) and will focus on the four following districts: Ferozkoh, Shahrak, Tulak and Taiwara, of Ghor Province, that have been identified by IOM as being among the 25 districts to be prioritized for COVID19 response since they are at higher risk of being affected by COVID19 outbreak.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the assistance will target the two following levels:\r\n-\tAt community level, with a strong focus on strengthening the good hygiene knowledge and practices among local population, in particular women and girls due to the disproportionate impact of the outbreak, in order to reduce the potential contamination vectors, notably through extensive handwashing practices. But, since lack of access to hygiene items is one of the main bottleneck preventing handwashing (with lack of access to water), a focus is also needed on facilitating the access to hygiene items for the most vulnerable part of the population and/or the part of the population at higher risk of being contaminated and/or developing complicated symptoms (SAM/MAM children, women attending ANC/PNC, elderly individuals, individuals with chronic diseases, IDPs). In addition, since COVID19 is a new kind of disease differing from the disease the local communities are aware of and have been sensitized on (COVID19 is not a water-borne disease), it is also necessary to raise the awareness of local population and key community leaders regarding COVID19’s specificities.\r\n-\tAt health facility level, with a strong focus on strengthening the hygiene/IPC measures and waste management systems enforced in each health facility. Doing so will allow to avoid health facilities to be become a COVID19 contamination cluster but will also allow the health facilities to continue providing lifesaving health amp nutrition services which will be even more crucial in the context of COVID19.\r\nBased on the designed program, AAH will provide support to 23 Health facilities including Provincial Hospital and Sar-miyash Hospital. Throughout the project, the required precautionary measures from MoPH and WHO guidelines, but also COVID19 Response plan, will be taken for group activities as well as for AAH’s staff."

          "On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for countries to prepare and respond to it in time. Afterwards, on 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic as it spreads to many countries. Globally, as of 10:00am CEST, 01 May 2020, a total of 3,175, 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 224, 172 deaths (CFR% 7.06%) have been reported to WHO from 215 countries, areas or territories. In the Sudan, according to the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), 91 new confirmed cases and associated 5 deaths of COVID-19 were reported on 01 May 2020 increasing the total number of confirmed cases to 533 with 36 associated deaths (CFR: 6.7 %) and 42 recovered cases. Majority of the confirmed cases (474 89%) are from Khartoum State  followed by Gezira (24 cases), Sinnar (8 case), North Kordofan (8 cases), River Nile (5 case), Gedaref (5 cases) and West Kordofan (2 cases). The government of Sudan has been implementing various “lock downs” to slow COVID-19 transmission by limiting contact between people. \r\n\r\nThe WHO has defined four transmission scenarios for COVID-19 and advised each country to assess its risk and rapidly implement the necessary measures at the appropriate scale at national and sub-national level as there is no one-size-fits-all. Accordingly, WHO classified the current transmission scenario in Sudan as “sporadic” as cases are either imported or locally detected. The WHO recommended that countries must do everything they can to stop cases from becoming clusters and clusters from becoming explosive outbreaks. As hitherto experiences attested, majority (80%) of COVID-19 patients developed into mild and moderate disease. Only 15% develops sever diseases while only 5% develops critical diseases requiring in patient care or Intensive Care Units (ICU) at designated isolation centres. Confirmed COVID-19 cases should be isolated in dedicated facilities to prevent transmission and optimize clinical care.  Rapid expansion of clinical care capacity to manage COVID-19 cases requires substantial reconfiguring of existing health facilities and repurposing existing health facilities to provide essential life-saving services. In Sudan, only 14 out of 46 (30%) designated COVID-19 isolation facilities in 14 States are functioning with a total capacity of 641 normal beds, 69 ICU beds and 53 ventilators as at 30 April 2020. Recent assessments by WHO revealed that there are huge gaps in the designated isolation centres prepared for management of COVID-19 cases in Sudan. Among other things, isolation centres and treatment facilities lack appropriate equipment, medicines, medical supplies and WASH facilities in most instances. The need for operational support to functional isolation centres was reported in many occasions. \r\n\r\nAlthough there were no suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases reported from the two-areas, it is a matter of time, since all the three countries neighboring them (South Sudan, Ethiopia and Sudan) already reported confirmed  COVID-19 cases and their transmission scenarios are fast progressing. Preventing importation of cases in underserved and marginalized communities such as the newly accessed two areas in South Kordofan and Blue Nile state is both critical and human-right issue. Such areas could serve as amplifiers of the pandemic becoming clusters of cases without timely intervention. Therefore, the two-areas are at greater risk of importation and local spread of COVID-19 without timely interventions. \r\n\r\nThis project is going to complement ongoing government, UN agencies and NGOs response effort under the auspices of the Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) to COVID-19. As WHO, this proposal will focus on addressing the three pillars of interventions (i.e. risk communication, IPC and case management) identified as critical gaps by the allocation paper in 11 prioritized States of Suda"

          "The world is currently facing a devastating scenario because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and all countries with confirmed cases are taking measures to react ranging from the lightest to the most severe to contain the transmission of the virus and protect people, especially to the most vulnerable.\rThe Mozambican government has also expressed its concerns in this regard and have put forward structural measures aimed at reducing the risk of infection by Covid-19. One of the measures taken was the declarationof State Emergency phase 3 as of 1 - 30 of April, then extended to 1 - 31 May 2020. The declaration of a state of emergency was accompanied by other related measures aimed at blocking the chain of contagion by Covid-19, such as the restriction of the number of people in the workplace, limitation of passengers number on public transport, obligation to wear masks in crowded places, closure of entertainment places,schools at all levels, among others.\r\rThe closure of schools, and social distance (includingconfinement of people at home), are in fact great measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in many rural communities in Mozambique, due to factorsassociated with poverty, access to information is limited. TV and the Internet isaccessible to a very limited group of people, which contributes to (i) exposure of communities to Covid-19, by ignoring disease prevention measures; (ii) Limits access to distance education for thousands of boys and (iii) girls and women may be exposed to situations of Gender Based Violence.\r\rOxfam Mozambique designed its response strategy to COVID-19 and has been looking for potential donors to materialize its activities. The Education Program for Active Citizenship and its partners is responsible  for implementing a part of this response strategy to Covid-19, during theschool closing period, by (i) disseminating Covid-19 prevention messages, (ii) piloting, together with local education authorities,radio-schools, to guarantee the right to education inthe face of Covid-19 and (iii) support youth organizations to prevention and  raise alert for Gender Based Violence  in context of COVID 19, due to women and girls confinement and permanent exposure.\r\rYoung women and men are a valuable resource and network during crises and public health emergencies. Through their informal and formal groupsand networks, they can help to break the chain of infection by working closely with their community, including the health authorities. Young people's involvement inthe COVID-19 response should be encouraged as they are drivers of change and educators in their communities and among their peers. In general, they are highly mobile, fast movers, entrepreneurs, innovators and users of various online communication and social media that can be used to mobilize people in responding to and preventing the COVID-19 pandemic.\rInspired on the above, Oxfam Mozambique intends, through youth engagement, to trigger actions in order to respond to 2 components of response to COVID-19 in two districts of Zambezia province, specifically Mocuba district through our local implementing partner NANA and Nocoadala through aour Local youth implanting partner ARZ (Associação das Raparigas da Zambezia)\r\rThe management of the project on the ground will be under the leadership of NANA, which will ensure the mobilization of young people to engage in community awareness campaigns to prevent Covid-19. NANA will also work in partnership with another youth organization, ARZ, to join efforts to prevent and report potential situations of gender-based violence at the community level. Relevant stakeholders such as community authorities and district services will also be involved in the implementation of this initiative to ensure ownership and continuity."

          "The world is currently facing a devastating scenario because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and all countries with confirmed cases are taking measures to react ranging from the lightest to the most severe to contain the transmission of the virus and protect people, especially to the most vulnerable.\rThe Mozambican government has also expressed its concerns in this regard and have put forward structural measures aimed at reducing the risk of infection by Covid-19. One of the measures taken was the declarationof State Emergency phase 3 as of 1 - 30 of April, then extended to 1 - 31 May 2020. The declaration of a state of emergency was accompanied by other related measures aimed at blocking the chain of contagion by Covid-19, such as the restriction of the number of people in the workplace, limitation of passengers number on public transport, obligation to wear masks in crowded places, closure of entertainment places,schools at all levels, among others.\r\rThe closure of schools, and social distance (includingconfinement of people at home), are in fact great measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in many rural communities in Mozambique, due to factorsassociated with poverty, access to information is limited. TV and the Internet isaccessible to a very limited group of people, which contributes to (i) exposure of communities to Covid-19, by ignoring disease prevention measures; (ii) Limits access to distance education for thousands of boys and (iii) girls and women may be exposed to situations of Gender Based Violence.\r\rOxfam Mozambique designed its response strategy to COVID-19 and has been looking for potential donors to materialize its activities. The Education Program for Active Citizenship and its partners is responsible  for implementing a part of this response strategy to Covid-19, during theschool closing period, by (i) disseminating Covid-19 prevention messages, (ii) piloting, together with local education authorities,radio-schools, to guarantee the right to education inthe face of Covid-19 and (iii) support youth organizations to prevention and  raise alert for Gender Based Violence  in context of COVID 19, due to women and girls confinement and permanent exposure.\r\rYoung women and men are a valuable resource and network during crises and public health emergencies. Through their informal and formal groupsand networks, they can help to break the chain of infection by working closely with their community, including the health authorities. Young people's involvement inthe COVID-19 response should be encouraged as they are drivers of change and educators in their communities and among their peers. In general, they are highly mobile, fast movers, entrepreneurs, innovators and users of various online communication and social media that can be used to mobilize people in responding to and preventing the COVID-19 pandemic.\rInspired on the above, Oxfam Mozambique intends, through youth engagement, to trigger actions in order to respond to 2 components of response to COVID-19 in two districts of Zambezia province, specifically Mocuba district through our local implementing partner NANA and Nocoadala through aour Local youth implanting partner ARZ (Associação das Raparigas da Zambezia)\r\rThe management of the project on the ground will be under the leadership of NANA, which will ensure the mobilization of young people to engage in community awareness campaigns to prevent Covid-19. NANA will also work in partnership with another youth organization, ARZ, to join efforts to prevent and report potential situations of gender-based violence at the community level. Relevant stakeholders such as community authorities and district services will also be involved in the implementation of this initiative to ensure ownership and continuity."

          "The world is currently facing a devastating scenario because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and all countries with confirmed cases are taking measures to react ranging from the lightest to the most severe to contain the transmission of the virus and protect people, especially to the most vulnerable.\rThe Mozambican government has also expressed its concerns in this regard and have put forward structural measures aimed at reducing the risk of infection by Covid-19. One of the measures taken was the declarationof State Emergency phase 3 as of 1 - 30 of April, then extended to 1 - 31 May 2020. The declaration of a state of emergency was accompanied by other related measures aimed at blocking the chain of contagion by Covid-19, such as the restriction of the number of people in the workplace, limitation of passengers number on public transport, obligation to wear masks in crowded places, closure of entertainment places,schools at all levels, among others.\r\rThe closure of schools, and social distance (includingconfinement of people at home), are in fact great measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in many rural communities in Mozambique, due to factorsassociated with poverty, access to information is limited. TV and the Internet isaccessible to a very limited group of people, which contributes to (i) exposure of communities to Covid-19, by ignoring disease prevention measures; (ii) Limits access to distance education for thousands of boys and (iii) girls and women may be exposed to situations of Gender Based Violence.\r\rOxfam Mozambique designed its response strategy to COVID-19 and has been looking for potential donors to materialize its activities. The Education Program for Active Citizenship and its partners is responsible  for implementing a part of this response strategy to Covid-19, during theschool closing period, by (i) disseminating Covid-19 prevention messages, (ii) piloting, together with local education authorities,radio-schools, to guarantee the right to education inthe face of Covid-19 and (iii) support youth organizations to prevention and  raise alert for Gender Based Violence  in context of COVID 19, due to women and girls confinement and permanent exposure.\r\rYoung women and men are a valuable resource and network during crises and public health emergencies. Through their informal and formal groupsand networks, they can help to break the chain of infection by working closely with their community, including the health authorities. Young people's involvement inthe COVID-19 response should be encouraged as they are drivers of change and educators in their communities and among their peers. In general, they are highly mobile, fast movers, entrepreneurs, innovators and users of various online communication and social media that can be used to mobilize people in responding to and preventing the COVID-19 pandemic.\rInspired on the above, Oxfam Mozambique intends, through youth engagement, to trigger actions in order to respond to 2 components of response to COVID-19 in two districts of Zambezia province, specifically Mocuba district through our local implementing partner NANA and Nocoadala through aour Local youth implanting partner ARZ (Associação das Raparigas da Zambezia)\r\rThe management of the project on the ground will be under the leadership of NANA, which will ensure the mobilization of young people to engage in community awareness campaigns to prevent Covid-19. NANA will also work in partnership with another youth organization, ARZ, to join efforts to prevent and report potential situations of gender-based violence at the community level. Relevant stakeholders such as community authorities and district services will also be involved in the implementation of this initiative to ensure ownership and continuity."

          "According to the 22 April 2020 dated 'Northwest Syria Task Force Situation Update', there have not yet been any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Northwest Syria. The World Health Organization through the coordination of UNOCHA and the Health Cluster based out of Gaziantep have put into action the 'COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan’ to ensure that the humanitarian community takes the necessary steps in preparing for any COVID-19 related eventuality. Even though the limited number of laboratory tests conducted so far have not produced any COVID-19 positive results, this does not negate the fact that Northwest Syria is classified as a ‘High Risk’ area in terms of the COVID-19 epidemic, as stated by the World Health Organization. \r\n\r\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak has led to a great imbalance of the supply and demand dynamics of acutely needed COVID-19 response related medical supplies and equipment. These supplies and equipment include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE’s) as well as ICU ventilators.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to support the COVID-19 response related supply chain of the international humanitarian community under the framework of the strategic principles put forward under the Northwest Syria COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan.\r\n\r\nThe project will thus procure within Turkey and deliver to World Health Organization (WHO) warehouse in Northwest Syria vital COVID-19 response related medical equipment and materials. These medical supplies will then be distributed to beneficiaries in Northwest Syria by the WHO. These medical equipment and materials will be consisting of Personal Protective Equipment as well as ventilators for medical staff working in the front lines of the COVID-19 response in Northwestern Syria.\r\n\r\nAs decided in coordination with the Health Cluster, the composition of the Personel Protective Equipment will be as follows: 1.300.000 units of 3 Layer Surgical Masks, 200.000 units of EN149 / FFP2 Masks, 100.000 units of Protective Suits, 27.000 units of Safety Goggles, 1.100.000 units of Powder-Free Nitrile Gloves. In addition 35 units of ICU ventilators will also be procured and delivered  to health facilities in need across the border in Northern Syria."

Even though the limited number of laboratory tests conducted so far have not produced any COVID-19 positive results, this does not negate the fact that Northwest Syria is classified as a ‘High Risk’ area in terms of the COVID-19 epidemic, as stated by the World Health Organization. \r\n\r\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak has led to a great imbalance of the supply and demand dynamics of acutely needed COVID-19 response related medical supplies and equipment. These supplies and equipment include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE’s) as well as ICU ventilators.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to support the COVID-19 response related supply chain of the international humanitarian community under the framework of the strategic principles put forward under the Northwest Syria COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan.\r\n\r\nThe project will thus procure within Turkey and deliver to World Health Organization (WHO) warehouse in Northwest Syria vital COVID-19 response related medical equipment and materials. These medical supplies will then be distributed to beneficiaries in Northwest Syria by the WHO. These medical equipment and materials will be consisting of Personal Protective Equipment as well as ventilators for medical staff working in the front lines of the COVID-19 response in Northwestern Syria.\r\n\r\nAs decided in coordination with the Health Cluster, the composition of the Personel Protective Equipment will be as follows: 1.300.000 units of 3 Layer Surgical Masks, 200.000 units of EN149 / FFP2 Masks, 100.000 units of Protective Suits, 27.000 units of Safety Goggles, 1.100.000 units of Powder-Free Nitrile Gloves.

          "The proposed operation is EUR 88 million loan to the Republic of Cameroon to finance the COVID-19 Crisis Response Budget Support Programme (PABRC). The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Cameroon dates back to 6 March 2020. By 2 June 2020, the country had more than [6 397] confirmed cases, including [3 629] recoveries and [199] deaths. The Centre (Yaoundé) and Littoral (Douala) Regions have the highest number of cases, representing about 55.8% and 32.2% of the total, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the structural weaknesses of the country’s health system and economy, particularly the limited human and financial resources allocated to the health sector. The programme has two components: (1) Strengthen the Response of the Health System and Mobilise Resources; and (2) Mitigate the Adverse Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy. This is a crisis response budget support as defined in the Operational Guidelines on the Programming, Design and Management of Programme-Based Support Operations – ADF/BD/IF/2014/35. The PABRC appraisal was conducted in April 2020 following a request submitted to the Bank on 9 April 2020 by the Government of Cameroon. It recommends two types of intervention: immediate actions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic, and long-term structural actions to build the resilience of the economy to serve as a basis for economic recovery. This operation is being considered within the framework of the COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility (CRF) set up by the Bank to protect its Regional Member Countries (RMCs) and their households and private sector enterprises from the economic and social impact of the pandemic.",
          "La présente intervention concerne un prêt d’un montant de 88 millions d’Euro à la République du Cameroun en vue du financement du Programme d’Appui budgétaire en Réponse à la Crise COVID-19 (PABRC). Au Cameroun le premier cas confirmé de la pandémie du COVID-19 date du 06 mars 2020. Au 2 juin 2020, le pays compte plus de [6 397] cas confirmés, dont [3 629] guérisons et [199] décès. Les régions du Centre (Yaoundé) et du Littoral (Douala) viennent en tête en termes de nombres des cas avec environ 55,8% et 32,2%, respectivement. La pandémie du COVID-19 a mis en évidence les faiblesses structurelles du système sanitaire du pays et de son économie, notamment les faibles ressources humaines et financières affectées à ce secteur. Le programme se décline en deux composantes : 1) Renforcement du système sanitaire de riposte et de la mobilisation des ressources ; et 2) Atténuation des effets néfastes du COVID-19 sur l’économie. Il s’agit d’un Appui Budgétaire en Réponse à une Crise tel que défini dans les directives opérationnelles sur la programmation, conception et gestion des opérations d’appui programmatique – ADF/BD/IF/2014/35. Le PABRC a été évalué au mois d’avril 2020, à la suite d’une demande du Gouvernement Camerounais adressée la Banque en date du 9 avril 2020. Il préconise deux types d’intervention, à savoir des actions d’atténuation immédiates des effets de la pandémie, et des actions structurelles de moyen long terme pour renforcer les capacités de résilience économique sur lesquelles la relance économique pourrait se baser. Cette opération est considérée dans le cadre de la Facilité de réponse rapide à la COVID-19 (CRF) que la Banque a mise en place afin de protéger ses Pays Membres Régionaux (PMR) et leurs ménages et entreprises privées de l’impact économique et social de la pandémie.",
          "The PABRC’s goal is to check the spread of the coronavirus to save lives by mitigating its adverse socioeconomic effects on the country, particularly on households and businesses. Specifically, the programme seeks to: (i) build capacity for COVID-19 testing, management and response by providing planning and strategic tools and adequate financial resources to the health sector; (ii) stabilise household income and livelihoods to safeguard food security and promote private consumption.",
          "Le PABRC a pour but de contenir la propagation du virus COVID-19 afin de sauver des vies en atténuant ses effets socio-économiques néfastes sur le pays, en particulier sur les ménages et entreprises. De façon spécifique, il s’agit de : (i) renforcer la capacité des tests de dépistage, prise en charge, et riposte sanitaire contre le COVID en dotant le secteur de la santé des outils de planification et de stratégie ainsi que des ressources financières adéquates ; (ii) stabiliser le revenu et les conditions de subsistance des ménages afin de préserver leur sécurité alimentaire, et soutenir par ce canal la consommation privée.",
          "The  direct  beneficiaries  are people infected with and  affected  by  COVID-19,  households  and enterprises. The indirect beneficiaries of the programme are the Government of Cameroon, through the ministries directly involved, and Cameroonian citizens and enterprises that will be protected against the rapid and continuous spread of COVID-19.",
          "Les  bénéficiaires  directs  du  programme  sont  les  personnes infectées,les  ménages  et  entreprises affectées par  le  COVID-19. Les  bénéficiaires indirects du programme sont l’Etat du  Cameroun,  à  travers  les 8 ministères  directement  impliqués,les  citoyens et  entreprises  camerounaises qui  seront  protégés contre une propagation rapide et continue du COVID-19."

          "This project seeks financing to protect vulnerable populations in northwest Syria in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic through gap filling approach in areas across the pillars 2- 8 of the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan: 2. Risk communication and community/public engagement 3. Surveillance, Rapid Response Teams (RRTs), and case investigation 4. Point of entry 5. Laboratory 6. Case management  7. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) 8. Operational support and logistics. With regard to the community health workers (CHWs) program response to COVID-19 (Pillar 2), WHO will enhance the level of population awareness of the COVID-19 and enhance preparedness of population to cope with the outbreak. More specifically, WHO will support local coordination of awareness activities review community leaders to be engaged conduct capacity building program to train CHWs on COVID-19 response develop and print IEC materials including banners, billboards, posters establish a central hotline and coordination team establish sub-district reporting networks for suspected cases (funded from WHO by a different source) establish a community survey for COVID-19 assessment recruit and train CHWs in the subdistricts with gaps identify community volunteers to provide PPE for CHWs teams (funded from WHO by a different source) provide basic hygiene items to be distributed in the outreach activities. With regards to EWARN response (Pillars 3 and 5), WHO will support the partner in surveillance and laboratory activities including a Training of Trainers (ToT) for 26 District Level Officers (DLOs), trainings on surveillance and response for 200 EWARN staff, enhance existing ILI and SARI surveillance to actively search for COVID-19, enhance monitoring and reporting of disease trends using appropriate data analysis, activate RRT and case-based reporting, contact tracing, follow up and share data with WHO per IHR, activate CBS in camps, as well as activate labs in Idlib to test for ILI/SARS/COVID-19 and scale-up training for staff. With regards to the primary healthcare (PHC) response to COVID-19 (Pillars 4, 6, 7, and 8), WHO will establish 7 points of entries (POE) to screen travelers, hire staff, as well as provide PPE, vehicles for transportation, and basic IPC training. With regards to secondary and tertiary healthcare (STHC) response (Pillar 6), WHO will maintain the operations, logistics, and human resources of three hospitals with specialized intensive care unit (ICU) capacity for confirmed COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and underlying chronic conditions. With regards to non-communicable disease management (Pillar 2), WHO will support primary healthcare centers working in non-communicable diseases and will ensure supply of NCD kits. More specifically, WHO will provide NCD messages specific for elderly and immunocompromised patients procure essential NCD drugs provide care via telemedicine for specific NCD patients with confirmed COVID-19 and those in ICUs and provide PPEs for NCD Care Teams within primary healthcare facilities. With regards to mental health program response (Pillars 2 and 6), WHO will implement mental health activities to respond to COVID-19 threat and potential outbreak in northwestern Syria. More specifically, WHO will produce IEC materials, will create and support mental health mobile clinics, create a MHPSS helpline for healthcare workers and COVID-19 patients and train  WASH staff, camp workers, community leaders, imams, youth leaders, women’s groups. The expected number of direct beneficiaries is 1,661,199."
